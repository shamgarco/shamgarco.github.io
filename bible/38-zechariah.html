										<h2>Zechariah</h2>


										<h4 id="zechariah-1">1</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, saying,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Jehovah was extremely angry with your fathers;<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Therefore say to them, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, Return to Me, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, Turn from your evil ways and from your evil deeds; but they did not hear nor hearken to Me, declares Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> But My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers, so that they returned and said, As Jehovah of hosts has thought to do with us, according to our ways and according to our deeds, so has He done with us?<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, saying,<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> I saw during the night, and behold, a man was riding upon a red horse; and He was standing among the myrtle trees that were in the bottoms; and behind Him there were red, reddish-brown, and white horses.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Then I said, What are these, sir? And the angel who spoke with me said to me, I will show you what these are.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are those whom Jehovah has sent to go to and fro on the earth.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And they answered the Angel of Jehovah, who was standing among the myrtle trees, and they said, We have gone to and fro on the earth, and indeed all the earth sits still and is quiet.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Then the Angel of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of hosts, how long will You not have compassion on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant for these seventy years?<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And Jehovah answered the angel who spoke with me with good words, with comforting words.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> So the angel who spoke to me said to me, Cry out, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts: I am greatly jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion;<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And I am extremely angry with the nations, who are at ease; for I was only a little angry, but their help increased the affliction.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Therefore thus says Jehovah, I return to Jerusalem with compassions; My house will be built in it, declares Jehovah of hosts, and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Cry out again, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, My cities will again overflow with good, and Jehovah will again comfort Zion and will again choose Jerusalem.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there were four horns.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And I said to the angel who spoke with me, What are these? And he said to me, These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Then Jehovah showed me four craftsmen.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And I said, What do these come to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns that have so scattered Judah that no man lifts up his head, but these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations who have lifted up the horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="zechariah-2">2</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Then I lifted up my eyes and I looked, and there was a man, and in His hand was a measuring line.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And I said, Where are You going? And He said to me, To measure Jerusalem; to see how great its breadth is and how great its length is.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Then at that point the angel who spoke with me went forth and another angel came forth to meet him.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And he said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem will lie as an open region due to the multitude of men and cattle within it,<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> For I will be her wall of fire round about, declares Jehovah, and I will be the glory within her.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Ho! Ho! Flee from the land of the north, declares Jehovah, for I have spread you out like the four winds of the heavens, declares Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Ho, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> For thus says Jehovah of hosts, After the glory He has sent Me against the nations who plunder you; for he who touches you touches the pupil of His eye.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> For I am now waving My hand over them, and they will be plunder for those who served them; and you will know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Give a ringing shout and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for now I am coming, and I will dwell in your midst, declares Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And many nations will join themselves to Jehovah in that day and will become My people; and I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me to you.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And Jehovah will inherit Judah as His portion upon the holy land, and He will again choose Jerusalem.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Hush, all flesh, before Jehovah! For He is roused up from His holy habitation.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="zechariah-3">3</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Then He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of Jehovah and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Jehovah rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, Jehovah, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the Angel.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And He answered and spoke to those standing before Him, saying, Remove the filthy garments from him. Then He said to him, See, I <i>hereby</i> make your iniquity pass from you and clothe you with stately robes.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And He said, Let them put a clean turban upon his head. And they put the clean turban upon his head and clothed him with garments while the Angel of Jehovah stood by.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And the Angel of Jehovah testified to Joshua, saying,<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Thus says Jehovah of hosts, If you will walk in My ways and if you will keep My charge, then you will both judge My house and keep My courts, and I will grant you to walk among these standing <i>here.</i><br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Hear then, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you — for they are men of symbol — for I am about to bring forth My servant, the shoot.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> For here is the stone that I have set before Joshua — upon one stone are seven eyes. I will engrave its engraving, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> In that day, declares Jehovah of hosts, each of you will invite his neighbor to <i>come</i> under the vine and under the fig tree.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="zechariah-4">4</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Then the angel who spoke with me returned and roused me as a man is roused from his sleep.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see that there is a lampstand all of gold, with its bowl on top of it and its seven lamps upon it, with seven pipes for each of the lamps on top of it;<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And <i>there are</i> two olive trees beside it, one to the right of the bowl and one to the left.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And I answered and spoke to the angel who spoke with me, saying, What are these, sir?<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And the angel who spoke with me answered and said to me, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, sir.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, says Jehovah of hosts.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel <i>you will become</i> a plain, and he will bring forth the topstone with shouts of Grace, grace to it!<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish <i>it;</i> and you will know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me to you.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> For who has despised the day of small things? For these seven rejoice when they see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel; they are the eyes of Jehovah running to and fro on the whole earth.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Then I answered and said to him, What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And I answered a second time and said to him, What are the two olive branches that are by the side of the two golden spouts, which empty the gold from themselves?<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And he spoke to me, saying, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, sir.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And he said, These are the two sons of oil, who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="zechariah-5">5</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Then I lifted up my eyes again and I saw, and there was a flying scroll.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see a flying scroll, its length twenty cubits and its breadth ten cubits.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Then he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of all the land; for everyone who steals will be purged according to what is on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged according to what is on the other side.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> I will cause it to go forth, declares Jehovah of hosts; and it will enter the house of him who steals and the house of him who swears falsely by My name; and it will lodge overnight within his house and consume it, both with its timbers and its stones.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Then the angel who spoke with me went forth and said to me, Lift up now your eyes and see what this is that goes forth.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah vessel that goes forth; and he said, This is their appearance in all the land;<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> (Then a lead cover was lifted up) and this is a woman sitting within the ephah vessel.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Then he said, This is Wickedness. And he threw her down into the midst of the ephah vessel and threw the lead weight over its opening.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Then I lifted up my eyes and I looked, and there were two women going forth, and the wind was in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork. And they lifted up the ephah vessel between the earth and the heavens.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And I said to the angel who spoke with me, Where are they taking the ephah vessel?<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And he said to me, To build a house for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there in her own place.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="zechariah-6">6</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Then I lifted up my eyes again and I looked, and there were four chariots coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of bronze.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> With the first chariot were red horses, and with the second chariot were black horses,<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And with the third chariot were white horses, and with the fourth chariot were strong, speckled horses.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And I answered and said to the angel who spoke with me, What are these, sir?<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And the angel answered and said to me, These are the four winds of heaven who go forth from presenting themselves to the Lord of the whole earth.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> With one of the winds the black horses went forth to the land of the north, and the white <i>horses</i> went forth after them, and the speckled <i>horses</i> went forth to the land of the south.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And the strong <i>horses</i> went forth and sought to proceed to go to and fro on the earth. And He said, Proceed to go to and fro on the earth; and they went to and fro on the earth.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Then He called out to me and spoke to me, saying, See, these who are going forth to the land of the north have given My Spirit rest in the land of the north.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Take from them of the captivity, from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, and go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have come from Babylon.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Indeed, take the silver and gold, and make a splendid crown and put it upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest,<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, saying, Here is a man, whose name is the Shoot; and he will shoot forth from his place and will build the temple of Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Indeed, it is he who will build the temple of Jehovah; and he will bear majesty and will sit and rule on his throne; and he will be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace will be between the two of them.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And the splendid crown will be as a reminder in the temple of Jehovah to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen the son of Zephaniah.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And those who are far off will come and build the temple of Jehovah, and you will know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me to you. And it will happen, if you fully obey the voice of Jehovah your God.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="zechariah-7">7</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> And in the fourth year of Darius the king the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah on the fourth <i>day</i> of the ninth month, <i>the month</i> Chislev.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Now <i>the people of</i> Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to entreat the favor of Jehovah<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> By speaking to the priests who belong to the house of Jehovah of hosts and to the prophets, saying, Shall I weep in the fifth month and separate myself, as I have done these many years?<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Then the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying,<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh <i>months,</i> even for these seventy years, was it at all for Me that you fasted?<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And when you eat and when you drink, are you not the ones eating and are you not the ones drinking?<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Are not <i>these</i> the words which Jehovah proclaimed by the former prophets when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous and <i>had</i> cities round about her, when the Negev and the lowlands were inhabited?<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, saying,<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, saying, Judge with judgment of truth, and show lovingkindness and compassion each to his brother;<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And do not oppress the widow and the orphan, the stranger and the poor; and let none of you think evil in your hearts about his brother.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> But they refused to listen, and they turned a stubborn shoulder and closed their ears from hearing;<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And they set their hearts like adamant so as not to hear the instruction and the words which Jehovah of hosts sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from Jehovah of hosts.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And as He called and they would not hear, so they called and I would not hear, says Jehovah of hosts;<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> But with a storm I scattered them away upon all the nations, whom they did not know. Thus the land is desolate behind them, so that no one passes through <i>it</i> and no one returns <i>to it;</i> for they have made the desirable land desolate.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="zechariah-8">8</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> And the word of Jehovah of hosts came, saying,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy; indeed, I am jealous for her with great wrath.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Thus says Jehovah, I return to Zion, and I will dwell within Jerusalem; and Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts, the Holy Mountain.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Thus says Jehovah of hosts, Yet again old men and old women will dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, each with his staff in his hand due to the multitude of <i>his</i> days.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And the streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Thus says Jehovah of hosts, If it seems too wonderful in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too wonderful in My sight? declares Jehovah of hosts.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I am about to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the going down of the sun.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And I will bring them, and they will dwell within Jerusalem; and they will be My people and I will be their God in truth and in righteousness.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Thus says Jehovah of hosts, Let your hands be strong, you who in these days hear these words from the mouth of the prophets who were <i>there</i> in the day when the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts, <i>that is,</i> the temple, was laid so that it might be built.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> For before those days a man’s wages amounted to nothing, and an animal’s wages were nothing; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace, because of the adversary; for I set all men each against his neighbor.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as I was in the former days, declares Jehovah of hosts;<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> For <i>there will be</i> peace for the seed: The vine will give forth its fruit, and the land will give forth its produce, and the heavens will give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> For thus says Jehovah of hosts, Just as I intended to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to anger, says Jehovah of hosts, and I did not repent,<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> So again I intend in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; do not fear.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> These are the things which you shall do: Each man speak truth to his neighbor; judge with truth and the judgment of peace in your gates;<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And let none of you think evil in your hearts about his neighbor; and do not love a false oath; for all these are the things I hate, declares Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Then the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying,<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> Thus says Jehovah of hosts, The fast of the fourth <i>month</i> and the fast of the fifth <i>month</i> and the fast of the seventh <i>month</i> and the fast of the tenth <i>month</i> will become joy and rejoicing and cheerful feasts to the house of Judah; therefore love truth and peace.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Thus says Jehovah of hosts, Peoples will again come, even the inhabitants of many cities;<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And the inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, Let us go at once to entreat the favor of Jehovah and to seek Jehovah of hosts; <i>and the other:</i> I will go too.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> Indeed, many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> Thus says Jehovah of hosts, In those days, from all the languages of the nations, ten men will take hold, indeed, they will take hold of the skirt of a Jewish man, saying, Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.<br>
										</p>

										<h4 id="zechariah-9">9</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> The burden of the word of Jehovah against the land of Hadrach, / And Damascus will be its resting place / (For Jehovah has an eye on man, / Especially on the tribes of Israel),<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And Hamath also, <i>which</i> borders on it; / Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> For Tyre built herself a stronghold / And heaped up silver like dust / And gold like the mire of the streets.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> The Lord is about to take possession of her, / And He will strike her might in the sea, / And she will be consumed with fire.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Ashkelon will see <i>it</i> and be afraid; / Gaza also, and it will writhe much in anguish; / And Ekron, for her expectation will have been confounded. / And the king will perish from Gaza, / And Ashkelon will not be inhabited.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And a mixed race will dwell in Ashdod, / And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And I will remove his blood from his mouth / And his detestable things from between his teeth; / And he also will remain unto our God; / And he will be like a leader in Judah, / And Ekron will be like a Jebusite.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And I will encamp around My house because of an army, / Because of him who passes by and returns; / And no oppressor will pass over them anymore; / For now I see with My eyes.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Exult greatly, O daughter of Zion; / Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! / Now your King comes to you. / He is righteous and bears salvation, / Lowly and riding upon a donkey, / Even upon a colt, the foal of a donkey,<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim / And the horse from Jerusalem, / And the battle bow will be cut off; / And He will speak peace unto the nations, / And His dominion will be from sea to sea / And from the River unto the ends of the earth.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> As for you also, because of the blood of your covenant, / I have released your captives from the pit, where there is no water.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Turn to the stronghold, O prisoners with hope. / This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> For I will bend Judah for Myself, / And I will fill a bow with Ephraim; / And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, / Against your sons, O Javan; / And I will make you like a warrior’s sword.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And Jehovah will appear above them, / And His arrow will go forth like lightning; / And the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, / And He will go in the whirlwinds of the south.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> Jehovah of hosts will defend them; / And they will devour and trample the sling stones. / And they will drink; they will be noisy as if with wine; / And they will be filled like a <i>sacrificial</i> basin, / Like the corners of the altar.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And Jehovah their God will save them in that day as the flock of His people, / For <i>they will be like</i> the stones of a crown, sparkling in His land.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> For how great is their goodness, and how great their beauty! / Grain will make the young men flourish, / And new wine, the virgins.<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> Ask rain of Jehovah / At the time of spring rain, / <i>Of</i> Jehovah who makes the lightning, / And He will give them showers of rain, / To everyone herbage in the field.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> For the teraphim have spoken vanity, / And the diviners have seen a lie / And have spoken false dreams; / They comforted in vain. / Therefore <i>the people</i> have wandered like sheep; / They are afflicted because there is no shepherd.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> My anger is kindled against the shepherds, / And I will punish the male goats; / For Jehovah of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, / And will make them like His horse of majesty in battle.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> From him will come forth the cornerstone, from him the peg, / From him the battle bow, / From him every ruler together.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And they will be as mighty men trampling <i>their enemies</i> / In the mire of the streets in the battle; / And they will fight, for Jehovah is with them; / And the riders of horses will be put to shame.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And I will strengthen the house of Judah, / And I will save the house of Joseph; / And I will bring them back, for I have had compassion on them; / And they will be as though I had not rejected them; / For I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And <i>they of</i> Ephraim will be like a mighty man, / And their hearts will rejoice as if with wine; / Indeed, their children will see <i>it</i> and rejoice; / Their heart will exult in Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> I will whistle for them and gather them, for I have redeemed them; / And they will multiply as they have multiplied.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And I will sow them among the peoples; and in distant lands they will remember Me; / And they will live with their children and return.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> I will also bring them back from the land of Egypt / And gather them out of Assyria; / And to the land of Gilead and Lebanon I will bring them; / And there will not be <i>enough room</i> found for them.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And He will pass through the sea <i>of</i> distress / And strike the waves in the sea, / And all the depths of the Nile will dry up; / And the pride of Assyria will be brought down, / And the scepter of Egypt will depart.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And I will strengthen them in Jehovah, / And they will walk about in His name, / Declares Jehovah.<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> Open your doors, O Lebanon, / That the fire may devour your cedars.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Howl, O fir tree, for the cedar has fallen, / Because the majestic <i>trees</i> are devastated. / Howl, O oaks of Bashan, / For the impenetrable forest is brought down.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> The sound of the howling of shepherds! / For their majesty is devastated. / The sound of the roaring of young lions! / For the pride of Jordan is devastated.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Thus says Jehovah my God, Shepherd the flock of slaughter,<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Whose owners slaughter them and are not punished; and they who sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich; and their own shepherds do not spare them.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> For I will no longer spare the inhabitants of the land, declares Jehovah; but I am about to cause each man to fall into his neighbor’s hand and into the hand of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their hand.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> So I shepherded the flock of slaughter, and thereby the afflicted of the flock. And I took to myself two staffs; one I called Favor, and the other I called Bonds; and I shepherded the flock.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Then I destroyed the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also detested me.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Then I said, I will not shepherd you. What is to die will die, and what is to be destroyed will be destroyed, and those who are left will each eat one another’s flesh.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And I took my staff, Favor, and I broke it in pieces so as to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And it was broken in that day; and thus the afflicted of the flock, who watched me, knew that it was the word of Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And I said to them, If it is good in your sight, give <i>me</i> my wages; but if not, do not bother. So they weighed out my wages, thirty <i>pieces</i> of silver.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And Jehovah said to me, Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price that I am priced with by them. So I took the thirty <i>pieces</i> of silver and threw them to the potter, into the house of Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Then I broke my second staff, Bonds, in pieces, so as to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And Jehovah said to me, Again, take the equipment of a foolish shepherd.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> For I am about to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not visit those who are perishing, nor seek the scattered, nor heal what is broken, nor sustain what stands, but will devour the flesh of the fat <i>ones</i> and tear off their hooves.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Woe to the worthless shepherd, / Who abandons the flock! / The sword <i>will fall</i> on his arm / And on his right eye. / His arm will be utterly withered, / And his right eye will be totally darkened.<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> The burden of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. <i>Thus</i> declares Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> I am about to make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the surrounding peoples; and when <i>what happens</i> in siege is upon Jerusalem, it will be upon Judah as well.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And in that day I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone to all the peoples; all who burden themselves with her will be cut up. Indeed all the nations of the earth will be gathered against her.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> In that day, declares Jehovah, I will strike every horse with bewilderment and its rider with madness; and I will open My eyes upon the house of Judah and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Then the leaders of Judah will say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem, by Jehovah of hosts their God, are my strength.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> In that day I will make the leaders of Judah like a fire pot on wood and like a torch of fire among sheaves, and they will consume all the surrounding peoples on the right and on the left. And Jerusalem will dwell again in her own place, in Jerusalem.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And Jehovah will save the tents of Judah first, so that the beauty of the house of David and the beauty of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not be magnified above Judah.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> In that day Jehovah will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the Angel of Jehovah before them.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And in that day I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and of supplications; and they will look upon Me, whom they have pierced; and they will wail over Him with wailing as for an only son and cry bitterly over Him with bitter crying as for a firstborn son.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> In that day there will be great wailing in Jerusalem, like the wailing of Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddon.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And the land will wail, every family by itself: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> The family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves;<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> All the families that remain, every family by itself, and their wives by themselves.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="zechariah-13">13</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> In that day there will be an opened fountain for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And in that day, declares Jehovah of hosts, I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass from the land.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And if anyone still prophesies, his father and mother, who begot him, will say to him, You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of Jehovah; and his father and mother, who begot him, will pierce him through when he prophesies.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And in that day the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies; and they will not wear a hairy garment in order to deceive.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> But He will say, I am no prophet; I am a tiller of the ground; for a man sold Me in My youth.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And <i>someone</i> will say to Him, What are these wounds between Your arms? And He will say, Those with which I was wounded in the house of those who love Me.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, / And against the man <i>who is</i> My Fellow, / Declares Jehovah of hosts. Strike the Shepherd, / That the sheep may be scattered; / And I will turn My hand upon the little ones.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And in all the land, declares Jehovah, / Two parts in it will be cut off <i>and</i> will die, / But the third part will be left in it.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And I will bring the third part through fire / And refine them as silver is refined / And try them as gold is tried. / They will call on My name, / And I will answer them; / I will say, They are My people, / And they will say, Jehovah is my God.<br>

										<h4 id="zechariah-14">14</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Indeed a day is coming for Jehovah when the spoil <i>taken</i> from you will be divided among you.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city will be captured, and the houses plundered, and the women ravished; and half of the city will go forth into captivity, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Then Jehovah will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights in a day of battle.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And His feet will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split at its middle toward the east and toward the west into a very great valley, so that half of the mountain will remove to the north and half of it to the south.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And you will flee into the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach unto Azel; yes, you will flee, just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah the king of Judah. And Jehovah my God will come, <i>and</i> all the saints with Him.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And in that day there will be no light; the shining ones will withdraw.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> For it will be a <i>kind of</i> day known only to Jehovah, neither day nor night; but at evening time there will be light.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And in that day living waters will go forth from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea and half of them toward the western sea; it will be there in summer and in winter.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And Jehovah will be King over all the earth; and in that day Jehovah will be the one <i>God</i> and His name the one <i>name.</i><br>
											 <sup>10</sup> All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and <i>Jerusalem</i> will be raised and will dwell in her place, from Benjamin’s Gate to the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and <i>from</i> the Tower of Hananel to the king’s winepresses.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And <i>people</i> will dwell in her, and there will be no more curse, for Jerusalem will dwell securely.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And this will be the plague with which Jehovah will strike all the peoples who have fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are standing on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And in that day a great panic from Jehovah will be among them; and each will seize his neighbor’s hand, and his hand will rise up against his neighbor’s hand.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And Judah will also fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together, gold and silver and garments, in great abundance.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And as this plague is, so will the plague be on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey, and all the cattle that are in those camps.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And everyone left from all the nations that went forth against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, upon them there will be no rain.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> And if the family of Egypt does not go up and enter, there will be no <i>rain</i> upon them; there will be the plague with which Jehovah strikes the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> This will be the sin of Egypt and the sin of all the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> In that day on the horses’ bells will be, Holiness to Jehovah; and the pots in the house of Jehovah will be like the basins before the altar.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> Indeed every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holiness to Jehovah of hosts; and all those who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them; and there will never again be a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah of hosts in that day.<br>
