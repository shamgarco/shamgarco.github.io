										<h2>Song of Songs</h2>


										<h4 id="songofsongs-1">1</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! / For your love is better than wine.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance; / Your name is like ointment poured forth; / Therefore the virgins love you.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Draw me; we will run after you — The king has brought me into his chambers — / We will be glad and rejoice in you; / We will extol your love more than wine. / Rightly do they love you.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> I am black but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, / Like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Do not look at me, because I am black, / Because the sun has scorched me. / My mother’s sons were angry with me; / They made me keeper of the vineyards, / <i>But</i> my own vineyard I have not kept.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture <i>your flock?</i> / Where do you make <i>it</i> lie down at noon? / For why should I be like one who is veiled / Beside the flocks of your companions?<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> If you yourself do not know, / You fairest among women, / Go forth on the footsteps of the flock, / And pasture your young goats / By the shepherds’ tents.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> I compare you, my love, / To a mare among Pharaoh’s chariots.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Your cheeks are lovely with plaits of ornaments, / Your neck with strings of jewels.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> We will make you plaits of gold / With studs of silver.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> While the king was at his table, / My spikenard gave forth its fragrance.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh / <i>That</i> lies at night between my breasts.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> My beloved is to me a cluster of henna flowers / In the vineyards of En-gedi.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> Oh, you are beautiful, my love! / Oh, you are beautiful! Your eyes are <i>like</i> doves.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Oh, you are beautiful, my beloved; indeed, pleasant! Indeed, our couch is green.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> The beams of our house are cedars; / Our rafters are cypresses.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="songofsongs-2">2</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> I am a rose of Sharon, / A lily of the valleys.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> As a lily among thorns, / So is my love among the daughters.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, / So is my beloved among the sons: In his shade I delighted and sat down, / And his fruit was sweet to my taste.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> He brought me into the banqueting house, / And his banner over me was love.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Sustain me with raisin cakes, / Refresh me with apples, / For I am sick with love.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> His left hand is under my head, / And his right hand embraces me.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / By the gazelles or by the hinds of the fields, / Not to rouse up or awaken <i>my</i> love / Until she pleases.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> The voice of my beloved! Now he comes, / Leaping upon the mountains, / Skipping upon the hills.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart. / Now he stands behind our wall; / He is looking through the windows, / He is glancing through the lattice.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> My beloved responds and says to me, / Rise up, my love, / My beauty, and come <i>away;</i><br>
											 <sup>11</sup> For now the winter is past; / The rain is over <i>and</i> gone.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Flowers appear on the earth; / The time of singing has come, / And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> The fig tree has ripened its figs, / And the vines are in blossom — they give forth their fragrance. / Rise up, my love, / My beauty, and come <i>away.</i><br>
											 <sup>14</sup> My dove, in the clefts of the rock, / In the covert of the precipice,Let me see your countenance, / Let me hear your voice; / For your voice is sweet, / And your countenance is lovely.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> Catch the foxes for us, / The little foxes, / That ruin the vineyards / While our vineyards are in blossom.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> My beloved is mine, and I am his; / He pastures <i>his flock</i> among the lilies.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Until the day dawns and the shadows flee away, / Turn, my beloved, <i>and</i> be like a gazelle or a young hart / On the mountains of Bether.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="songofsongs-3">3</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> On my bed night after night / I sought him whom my soul loves; / I sought him, but found him not.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> I will rise now and go about in the city; / In the streets and in the squares / I will seek him whom my soul loves. / I sought him, but found him not.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> The watchmen who go about in the city found me — / Have you seen him whom my soul loves?<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Scarcely had I passed them / When I found him whom my soul loves; / I held him and would not let go / Until I had brought him into my mother’s house / And into the chamber of her who conceived me.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / By the gazelles or by the hinds of the fields, / Not to rouse up or awaken <i>my</i> love / Until she pleases.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Who is she who comes up from the wilderness / Like pillars of smoke, / Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, / With all the fragrant powders of the merchant?<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> There is Solomon’s bed; / Sixty mighty men surround it, / Of the mighty men of Israel.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> All of them wield the sword <i>and</i> are expert in war; / Each man has his sword at his thigh / Because of the night alarms.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> King Solomon made himself a palanquin / Of the wood of Lebanon.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Its posts he made of silver; / Its bottom, of gold; / Its seat, of purple; / Its midst was inlaid <i>with</i> love / From the daughters of Jerusalem.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Go forth, O daughters of Zion, / And look at King Solomon with the crown / With which his mother crowned him / On the day of his espousals, / Yes, on the day of the gladness of his heart.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="songofsongs-4">4</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Oh, you are beautiful, my love! / Oh, you are beautiful! Your eyes are <i>like</i> doves behind your veil; / Your hair is like a flock of goats / That repose on Mount Gilead.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes / That have come up from the washing, / All of which have borne twins, / And none of them is bereaved of her young.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Your lips are like a scarlet thread, / And your mouth is lovely; / Your cheeks are like a piece of pomegranate / Behind your veil.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Your neck is like the tower of David, / Built for an armory: / A thousand bucklers hang on it, / All the shields of the mighty men.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Your two breasts are like two fawns, / Twins of a gazelle, / That feed among the lilies.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Until the day dawns and the shadows flee away, / I, for my part, will go to the mountain of myrrh / And to the hill of frankincense.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> You are altogether beautiful, my love, / And there is no blemish in you.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> <i>Come</i> with me from Lebanon, <i>my</i> bride; / With me from Lebanon come. / Look from the top of Amana, / From the top of Senir and Hermon, / From the lions’ dens, / From the leopards’ mountains.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> You have ravished my heart, my sister, <i>my</i> bride; / You have ravished my heart with one <i>glance</i> of your eyes, / With one strand of your necklace.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> How beautiful is your love, my sister, <i>my</i> bride! / How much better is your love than wine, / And the fragrance of your ointments / Than all spices!<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Your lips drip fresh honey, <i>my</i> bride; / Honey and milk are under your tongue; / And the fragrance of your garments / Is like the fragrance of Lebanon.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> A garden enclosed is my sister, <i>my</i> bride, / A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates / With choicest fruit; / Henna with spikenard,<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Spikenard and saffron; / Calamus and cinnamon, / With all the trees of frankincense; / Myrrh and aloes, / With all the chief spices.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> A fountain in gardens, / A well of living water, / And streams from Lebanon.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Awake, O north wind; / And come, O south wind! / Blow upon my garden: / Let its spices flow forth; / Let my beloved come into his garden / And eat his choicest fruit.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="songofsongs-5">5</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> I have come into my garden, my sister, <i>my</i> bride; / I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; / I have drunk my wine with my milk. / Eat, O friends; / Drink, and drink deeply, O beloved ones!<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> I sleep, but my heart is awake. / A sound! My beloved is knocking. / Open to me, my sister, my love, / My dove, my perfect one; / For my head is drenched with dew, / My locks with the drops of night.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> I have put off my garment; / How can I put it on <i>again?</i> / I have washed my feet; / How can I dirty them <i>again?</i><br>
											 <sup>4</sup> My beloved put his hand into the opening <i>of the door,</i> / And my inner parts yearned for him.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> I rose up to open to my beloved; / And my hands dripped with myrrh, / My fingers with liquid myrrh, / Upon the handles of the bolt.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> I opened to my beloved, / But my beloved had withdrawn; he was gone. / My soul failed when he spoke; / I sought him, but found him not; / I called him — he answered me not.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> The watchmen who go about the city found me. / They struck me; they wounded me; / The keepers of the walls took my veil from me.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / If you find my beloved, / What shall you tell him? / That I am sick with love.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> What is your beloved more than <i>some other’s</i> beloved, / O you most beautiful among women? / What is your beloved more than <i>some other’s</i> beloved, / That you adjure us so?<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> My beloved is dazzling white yet ruddy, / Distinguished among ten thousand.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> His head is the finest gold; / His locks are wavy, / As black as a raven.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> His eyes are like doves / Beside the streams of water, / Bathed in milk, / Fitly set.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> His cheeks are like a bed of spices, / Mounds of sweetly fragrant herbs; / His lips are lilies, / Dripping with liquid myrrh.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> His hands are tubes of gold, / Set with beryl; / His belly is an ivory work, / Overlaid with sapphires.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> His legs are pillars of white marble, / Set upon bases of gold; / His appearance is like Lebanon, / As excellent as the cedars.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> His mouth is sweetness itself, / And he is altogether desirable. / This is my beloved, and this is my friend, / O daughters of Jerusalem.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="songofsongs-6">6</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Where has your beloved gone, / O you most beautiful among women? / Where has your beloved turned, / That we may seek him with you?<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> My beloved has gone down to his garden, / To the beds of spices, / To feed in the gardens / And gather lilies.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine; / He pastures <i>his flock</i> among the lilies.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> You are as beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, / As lovely as Jerusalem, / As terrible as an army with banners.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Turn your eyes away from me, / For they overwhelm me. / Your hair is like a flock of goats / That repose on Mount Gilead.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Your teeth are like a flock of ewes / That have come up from the washing, / All of which have borne twins, / And none of them is bereaved of her young.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Your cheeks are like a piece of pomegranate / Behind your veil.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> There are sixty queens and eighty concubines / And virgins without number.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> My dove, my perfect one, is but one; / She is the only one of her mother; / She is the choice one of her who bore her. / The daughters saw her, and they called her blessed; / The queens and the concubines, / They also praised her.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Who is this woman who looks forth like the dawn, / As beautiful as the moon, / As clear as the sun, / As terrible as an army with banners?<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> I went down to the orchard of nuts / To see the freshness of the valley, / To see whether the vine had budded, / Whether the pomegranates were in bloom.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Before I was aware, / My soul set me <i>among</i> the chariots of my noble people.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Return, return, O Shulammite; / Return, return, that we may gaze at you. / Why should you gaze at the Shulammite, / As upon the dance of two camps?<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="songofsongs-7">7</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> How beautiful are your footsteps in sandals, / O prince’s daughter! / Your rounded thighs are like jewels, / The work of the hands of a skilled artist.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Your navel is a round goblet / That never lacks mixed wine; / Your belly is a heap of wheat, / Fenced in by lilies.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Your two breasts are like two fawns, / Twins of a gazelle.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Your neck is like a tower of ivory; / Your eyes, <i>like</i> the pools in Heshbon / By the gate of Bath-rabbim; / Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, / Which faces Damascus.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Your head upon you is like Carmel, / And the locks of your head like purple. / The king is fettered by <i>your</i> tresses.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> How beautiful and how pleasant in delights / You are, O love!<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> This your stature is like a palm tree, / And your breasts are <i>like</i> the clusters.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> I said, I will climb the palm tree; / I will take hold of its branches; / And let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, / And the fragrance of your nose like apples,<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And the roof of your mouth like the best wine — Going down smoothly for my beloved, / Gliding through the lips of those who sleep.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> I am my beloved’s, / And his desire is for me.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields; / Let us lodge in the villages.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Let us rise up early for the vineyards; / Let us see if the vine has budded, / <i>If</i> the blossom is open, / <i>If</i> the pomegranates are in bloom; / There I will give you my love.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> The mandrakes give forth fragrance, / And over our doors are all choice fruits, / New as well as old. / <i>These,</i> my beloved, I have stored up for you.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="songofsongs-8">8</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Oh that you were like a brother to me, / Who nursed at my mother’s breasts! / If I found you outside, I would kiss you, / And none would despise me.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> I would lead you <i>and</i> bring you / Into my mother’s house, / Who has instructed me; / I would make you drink spiced wine / From the juice of my pomegranate.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> His left hand would be under my head, / And his right hand would embrace me.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / Do not rouse up or awaken <i>my</i> love / Until she pleases.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, / Leaning on her beloved? / I awakened you under the apple tree: / There your mother was in labor with you; / There she was in labor <i>and</i> brought you forth.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Set me as a seal on your heart, / As a seal on your arm; / For love is as strong as death, / Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol; / Its flashes are the flashes of fire, / A flame of Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Many waters cannot quench love, / Nor do floods drown it. / If a man gave all the substance of his house for love, / It would be utterly despised.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> We have a little sister, / And she has no breasts: / What shall we do for our sister / On the day when she is spoken for?<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> If she is a wall, / We will build on her a battlement of silver; / And if she is a door, / We will enclose her with boards of cedar.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers; / Then I was in his eyes like one who has found peace.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon: / He let out the vineyard to keepers; / Each was to bring a thousand <i>shekels</i> of silver for its fruit.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> My vineyard, which is mine, is before me. / You will have the thousand, O Solomon; / And those who keep its fruit, two hundred.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> O you who dwell in the gardens, / <i>My</i> companions listen for your voice; / Let me hear <i>it.</i><br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Make haste, my beloved, / And be like a gazelle or a young hart / Upon the mountains of spices.<br>
