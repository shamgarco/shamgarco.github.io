											 <sup>27</sup> And they spent the night around the house of God because the charge of the watch was upon them; and they had charge of opening it morning by morning.<br>

											 <sup>3</sup> And the battle bore heavily against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was wounded by the archers.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Then Saul said to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not, for he was very afraid. So Saul took his sword and fell on it.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword and died.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> So Saul and his three sons died, and all his house died together.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And the next day the Philistines came to strip the slain, and they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And they stripped him and took his head and his armor, and they sent <i>them</i> all around, throughout the land of the Philistines in order to announce the good news to their idols and to the people.<br>

											 <sup>13</sup> So Saul died on account of his unfaithfulness which he committed against Jehovah, because of the word of Jehovah which he did not keep, and also because he asked <i>the counsel</i> of a medium, inquiring <i>of it.</i><br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And he did not inquire of Jehovah; therefore He killed him and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.<br>

											 <sup>3</sup> And all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron. And David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah, and they anointed David king over Israel according to the word of Jehovah <i>spoken</i> by Samuel.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, that is, Jebus; and the Jebusites were the inhabitants of the land there.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You shall not come in here. But David took the stronghold of Zion, which is <i>now</i> the city of David.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And David said, Whoever strikes the Jebusites first will be the chief and the captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> So David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And he built the city all around, from the Millo even unto the surrounding area, and Joab repaired the rest of the city.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And David became greater and greater, and Jehovah of hosts was with him.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king according to the word of Jehovah concerning Israel.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And these are the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he brandished his spear against three hundred, <i>and they were</i> slain at one time.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite; he was among the three mighty men.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> He was with David at Pas-dammim, and the Philistines gathered themselves there for battle, and there was a plot of land full of barley <i>there;</i> and the people fled before the Philistines.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> But they stationed themselves in the midst of the plot and delivered it and struck the Philistines, and Jehovah accomplished a great salvation.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> Now three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David in the cave of Adullam while the army of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Now at that time David was in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem at that time.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And David said longingly, If only someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> And the three burst through the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate. And they carried <i>it</i> and brought <i>it</i> to David, but David would not drink it; rather he poured it out to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And he said, Far be it from me, before my God, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men <i>who went</i> at <i>the risk of</i> their lives?

											 <sup>20</sup> And Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the three. And he brandished his spear against three hundred, <i>who were</i> slain; and he had a name among the three.<br>

											 <sup>22</sup> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, was great in mighty deeds. He struck the two <i>sons</i> of Ariel the Moabite; he also went down and struck a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And he struck an Egyptian, a man of <i>great</i> stature, five cubits tall. And the Egyptian had a spear in his hand like a weaver’s beam, but he went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian and slew him with his own spear.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and he had a name among the three mighty men.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> He was indeed more honored than the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.<br>

											 <sup>2</sup> They drew the bow, and with both right and left hands they could sling stones and shoot arrows with the bow; they were from among the brothers of Saul from Benjamin.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Beracah and Jehu the Anathothite;<br>

											 <sup>9</sup> Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,<br>

											 <sup>11</sup> Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> These from among the sons of Gad were heads of the army; he who was least was equal to a hundred, and the greatest to a thousand.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> These are the ones who crossed over the Jordan in the first month, when it overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all those of the valleys, to the east and to the west.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And some of the children of Benjamin and Judah came to David at the stronghold.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And David went out to meet them; and he responded and said to them, If you have come to me in peace in order to help me, my heart will be knit to you; but if <i>you have come</i> to betray me to my adversaries, though there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers see and reprove.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, the head of the thirty, <i>and he said,We</i> are yours, O David, / And are with you, O son of Jesse. / Peace, peace be with you, / And peace with those who help you; / For your God helps you.And David received them and made them heads of the troops.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And some from Manasseh fell away to David when he came with the Philistines for battle against Saul. (But they did not help them, for the lords of the Philistines, upon deliberation, sent him away, saying, He will fall back to his master Saul at the cost of our heads.)<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> As he went to Ziklag, some fell away to him: Adnah and Jozabad and Jediael and Michael and Jozabad and Elihu and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were from Manasseh.<br>

											 <sup>22</sup> Indeed day by day they came to David to help him, until there was a great army, like the army of God.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And these are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war <i>and</i> came to David at Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul unto him according to the word of Jehovah:<br>

											 <sup>29</sup> And of the children of Benjamin, the brothers of Saul, three thousand; for until that time the greater part of them kept their allegiance to the house of Saul;<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> And of the children of Ephraim, twenty thousand eight hundred mighty men of valor, men of renown in their fathers’ houses;<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> And of the half-tribe of Manasseh, eighteen thousand, who were designated by name to come and make David king.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> And of the children of Issachar, men who understood the times that they might know what Israel should do, the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brothers were at their command;<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> Of Zebulun, those who were able to go forth in war, who could set the battle in array with all the equipment of war, were fifty thousand, and they helped <i>David</i> without a double heart;<br>

											 <sup>38</sup> All these, men of war who could order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest of Israel as well were of one heart to make David king.<br>

											 <sup>11</sup> And David was angry because Jehovah had broken forth with an outburst upon Uzzah, and he called that place Perez-uzzah, <i>as it is</i> to this day.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the Ark of God to myself?<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> So David did not remove the Ark to himself to the city of David, but he carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.<br>

											 <sup>19</sup> So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <i>were appointed</i> to sound aloud with bronze cymbals;<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> And Zechariah and Aziel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Unni and Eliab and Maaseiah and Benaiah with harps <i>set</i> to alamoth;<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And Mattithiah and Eliphelehu and Mikneiah and Obed-edom and Jeiel and Azaziah <i>were appointed</i> to lead with lyres <i>set</i> to sheminith.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> And Chenaniah, the leader of the Levites, was over the song; he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the Ark.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> And Shebaniah and Joshaphat and Nethanel and Amasai and Zechariah and Benaiah and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before the Ark of God; and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the Ark.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> So David and the elders of Israel and the captains of thousands went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah from the house of Obed-edom with rejoicing.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> And because God helped the Levites who bore the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> And David was clothed with a fine linen robe, as were all the Levites who bore the Ark and the singers and Chenaniah, the song leader of the singers; and David had on a linen ephod.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> So all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah with shouting and with the sound of the horn and with trumpets and with cymbals, sounding aloud with harps and lyres.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> And when the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked down through a window and saw King David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> And they brought the Ark of God and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it. And they offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And when David finished offering up the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And he apportioned to everyone of Israel, to both men and women, to each one, a cake of bread and a portion of meat and a cake of raisins.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And he appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the Ark of Jehovah and to commemorate and thank and praise Jehovah the God of Israel:<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Asaph the chief; and second to him Zechariah; Jeiel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Mattithiah and Eliab and Benaiah and Obed-edom and Jeiel, with harps and with lyres; and Asaph sounding aloud with cymbals;<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the Ark of the Covenant of God.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> On that day, at that time, David first ordained the giving of thanks to Jehovah by the hand of Asaph and his brothers.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Give thanks to Jehovah; call upon His name; / Make known His deeds among the peoples.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Sing to Him; sing psalms to Him; / Muse upon all His wondrous deeds.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Glory in His holy name; / Let the heart of those who seek Jehovah rejoice.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Seek Jehovah and His strength; / Seek His face continually.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Remember His wondrous deeds, which He has done, / His signs and the judgments of His mouth,<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> O seed of Israel His servant, / O children of Jacob, His chosen ones.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> He is Jehovah our God; / His judgments are in all the earth.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> Remember His covenant forever, / The word that He commanded to a thousand generations,<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> <i>The</i> <i>covenant</i> that He made with Abraham, / And His oath unto Isaac.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And He confirmed it unto Jacob as a statute, / Unto Israel <i>as</i> an eternal covenant,<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Saying, To you I will give the land of Canaan, / The portion of your inheritance;<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> When you were men few in number, / Indeed very few and strangers in the land;<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> And they went about from nation to nation, / And from <i>one</i> kingdom to another people.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> He allowed no man to oppress them; / Indeed He rebuked kings for their sake.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> <i>Saying,</i> Do not touch My anointed ones, / And do My prophets no harm.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> Sing to Jehovah all the earth; / Proclaim His salvation from day to day.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Declare His glory among the nations, / His wondrous deeds among all the peoples.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> For Jehovah is great and much to be praised, / And He is to be feared above all gods.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> For all the gods of the peoples are idols, / But Jehovah made the heavens.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> Majesty and splendor are before Him; / Strength and gladness are in His place.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> Ascribe to Jehovah, O families of the peoples, / Ascribe to Jehovah, glory and strength;<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> Ascribe to Jehovah the glory of His name; / Bring an offering, and come before Him. / Worship Jehovah in holy splendor;<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> Tremble before Him, all the earth. / Indeed the world has been established; it will not be moved;<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> Let the heavens rejoice and the earth be glad; / And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigns!<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> Let the sea and its fullness roar; / Let the field and all that is in it exult;<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy / Before Jehovah, for He is coming / To judge the earth.<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good, / For His lovingkindness is forever;<br>
											 <sup>35</sup> And say, Save us, O God of our salvation; / And gather us and deliver us out of the nations, / That we may give thanks to Your holy name, / That we may glory in Your praise.<br>
											 <sup>36</sup> Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, / From eternity to eternity.And all the people said, Amen, and praised Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>37</sup> So there before the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah he left Asaph and his brothers to minister before the Ark continually, as every day’s work dictated;<br>
											 <sup>38</sup> As well as Obed-edom and his sixty-eight relatives, with Obed-edom the son of Jeduthun and Hosah as gatekeepers;<br>
											 <sup>39</sup> And Zadok the priest and his brothers the priests before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place which was at Gibeon,<br>
											 <sup>40</sup> To offer up burnt offerings to Jehovah upon the burnt offering altar continually every morning and every evening, according to all that was written in the law of Jehovah, which He commanded Israel.<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> And as David dwelt in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah dwells under curtains.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And Nathan said to David, All that is in your heart do, for God is with you.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And in that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying,<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Go and say to David My servant, Thus says Jehovah, It will not be you who builds Me a house to dwell in.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> For I have not dwelt in a house, since the day I brought up Israel to this day; but I have been from tent to tent and from tabernacle <i>to tabernacle.</i><br>
											 <sup>6</sup> In all My going about among all Israel, did I ever speak a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And now thus shall you say to My servant David, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you might be ruler over My people Israel;<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And I have been with you in every place that you have gone and have cut off all your enemies before you; and I will make a name for you, like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And I will appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them <i>there,</i> that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more; and the sons of wickedness will waste <i>them</i> away no more as before,<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Even since the time when I commanded <i>that there be</i> judges over My people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I declare to you that Jehovah will build you a house.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> When your days are fulfilled that you must go <i>to be</i> with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you, which will be from your sons, and I will establish his kingdom.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> It is he who will build a house for Me, and I will establish his throne forever.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> I will be his Father, and he will be My son; and My lovingkindness I will not take from him, as I took <i>it</i> away from <i>him</i> who was before you.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And I will set him in My house and My kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> According to all these words and according to this whole vision did Nathan speak to David.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Then King David went and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house that You have brought me this far?<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And this was a small thing in Your sight, O God; but You have spoken of the house of Your servant for a great while to come; and You have regarded me according to the custom for a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> What more can David add <i>to say</i> to You concerning <i>this</i> honoring of Your servant? For You know Your servant.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> O Jehovah, for Your servant’s sake and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness to make known all <i>these</i> great things.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> O Jehovah, there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And who is like Your people Israel, a nation unique on the earth, which God went to redeem to Himself as a people in order to make for Yourself a name of greatness and awesomeness to drive out nations from before Your people, whom You have redeemed out of Egypt?<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> And You have made Your people Israel to be a people to You forever, and You, O Jehovah, became their God.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And now, O Jehovah, may the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as You have spoken.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> And may Your name be established and magnified forever when <i>men</i> say, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel; and the house of David Your servant will be established before You.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> For You, O my God, have revealed to Your servant, that You will build him a house; therefore Your servant has found <i>it in his heart</i> to pray before You.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> And now, O Jehovah, You are God, and You have spoken this good matter concerning Your servant;<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> Now therefore You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant, that it may be before You forever; for You, O Jehovah, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.<br>

											 <sup>8</sup> And from Tibhath and Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the vessels of bronze.<br>

											 <sup>11</sup> King David consecrated these also to Jehovah along with the silver and gold that he had carried from all the nations: from the Edomites and from the Moabites and from the children of Ammon and from the Philistines and from the Amalekites.<br>

											 <sup>3</sup> But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Do you really think that David is honoring your father just because he sent to you some men to comfort <i>you?</i> Have not his servants come to you in order to search out and to overthrow and to spy on the land?<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved them and cut away half their garments at the hips, and he sent them away.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Now when they went and told David about the men, he sent <i>some</i> to meet them, for the men were very ashamed. And the king said, Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back, then return.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia and from the Syrians of Maacah and from Zobah.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and camped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered together from their cities and came to the battle.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And when David heard <i>of it,</i> he sent Joab and all the host of mighty men.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And the children of Ammon went forth and set the battle in array at the entrance of the city, but the kings who had come were alone in the field.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Now when Joab saw that there were battle lines against him before and behind, he chose some of the choice men in Israel and set them in array against the Syrians.<br>

											 <sup>2</sup> And David took the crown of their king from off his head and found <i>it</i> to weigh a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was <i>put</i> upon David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, a very great amount.<br>

											 <sup>3</sup> And Joab said, May Jehovah add to His people a hundred times as many as they are. But, O my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord request this? Why should he become a cause of guilt to Israel?<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed over Joab, and Joab went forth and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. And all Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and Judah was four hundred seventy thousand men who drew the sword.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> But he did not number Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s word was abhorrent to Joab.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And this matter displeased God, and He struck Israel.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And David said to God, I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing; but now put away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And Jehovah spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying,<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Go and speak to David, saying, Thus says Jehovah, I am offering you three things; choose for yourself one of them, that I may do <i>it</i> to you.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> So Gad went to David and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Take for yourself<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Either three years of famine, or three months to be swept away before your adversaries, while the sword of your enemies overtakes <i>you,</i> or three days of the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the territory of Israel. And now see what word I should return to Him who sent me.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait; let me fall into the hand of Jehovah, for His compassions are very great; and do not let me fall into the hand of man.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> So Jehovah sent a pestilence in Israel, and seventy thousand people of Israel fell.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but as he was destroying <i>it,</i> Jehovah saw and repented of the harm. And He said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now hold back your hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of Jehovah standing between the earth and the heavens, with his drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, covered with sackcloth, fell on their faces.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And David said to God, Was it not I who ordered the numbering of the people? And it is I who have sinned and acted very wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? O Jehovah my God, let Your hand, I pray, be against me and against the house of my father, but not against Your people that they should be plagued.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> And the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise up an altar to Jehovah on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And David went up at Gad’s word, which he spoke in the name of Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> And Ornan turned back and saw the angel, and his four sons <i>who were</i> with him hid themselves; and Ornan was threshing wheat.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David. And he went forth from the threshing floor and bowed down to David with <i>his</i> face to the ground.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> And David said to Ornan, Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to Jehovah. For the full price you shall give it to me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And Ornan said to David, Take <i>it;</i> and may my lord the king do whatever seems good in his sight. Look, I have given the oxen for the burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for the wood and the wheat for the meal offering — all this I give.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> But King David said to Ornan, No; but I will surely buy <i>it</i> for the full price, for I will not take what is yours for Jehovah and offer up burnt offerings that cost me nothing.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the site.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> And there David built an altar to Jehovah, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And he called on Jehovah, and He answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> And Jehovah commanded the angel, and he returned his sword to its sheath.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> And the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering at that time were in the high place at Gibeon.<br>

											 <sup>3</sup> And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails of the doors of the gates and for the clasps; and bronze in abundance, without weight;<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And cedar trees without number, for the Sidonians and the Tyrians brought cedar trees in vast quantity to David.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built to Jehovah must be exceedingly great in fame and glory throughout all lands; I will therefore make preparations for it. So David prepared an abundance before his death.<br>

											 <sup>7</sup> And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was on my heart to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> But the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly and have waged great wars. You shall not build a house for My name, for you have shed much blood on the earth in My sight.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Behold, a son will be born to you. He will be a man of rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies around <i>him,</i> for Solomon will be his name, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel throughout his days.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> It is he who will build a house for My name; and he will be My son, and I will be his Father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Now, my son, may Jehovah be with you; and may you prosper and build the house of Jehovah your God, as He has spoken concerning you.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Only, let Jehovah give you insight and understanding, and let Him give you charge over Israel that you may keep the law of Jehovah your God;<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Then you will prosper if you are certain to perform the statutes and ordinances with which Jehovah charged Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and be bold; do not be afraid or dismayed.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Now then in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah one hundred thousand talents of gold and one million talents of silver and bronze and iron without weight, for it is in abundance; and timber and stone I have prepared; and you may add to these.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And with you there are workmen in abundance, masons and workers in stone and wood and all manner of men who are skillful in every kind of work.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> To the gold and silver and bronze and iron there is no number. Arise and do <i>it,</i> and may Jehovah be with you.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And David commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, <i>saying,</i><br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Indeed Jehovah your God is with you. And He has given you rest all around. For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land has been subdued before Jehovah and before His people.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Jehovah your God; and arise and build the sanctuary of Jehovah God, in order to bring the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah and all the holy vessels of God to the house that is to be built for the name of Jehovah.<br>

											 <sup>4</sup> Of these twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Jehovah, and six thousand were officers and judges,<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And four thousand were gatekeepers, and four thousand were to praise Jehovah with the instruments that I have made for praising, <i>said David.</i><br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And David formed them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief and Zetham and Joel, three.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth and Haziel and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’ <i>houses</i> of Ladan.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second. But Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; therefore they became a father’s house in one reckoning.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated that he might sanctify the most holy things forever, he and his sons, by burning incense before Jehovah, by ministering to Him, and by blessing in His name forever.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And the sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.<br>

											 <sup>25</sup> For David said, Jehovah the God of Israel has given rest to His people, and He will dwell in Jerusalem forever;<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> And also the Levites need not carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered from twenty years and upward.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> For their station was alongside the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah in the courts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all the holy things, that is, the work of the service of the house of God;<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> And for the rows of bread and the fine flour of the meal offering and the unleavened wafers and <i>what is baked in</i> the pan and what is mixed <i>with oil</i> and all measures of quantity and size;<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> And to stand morning by morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise in the evening;<br>

											 <sup>8</sup> And those with whom gems were found gave <i>them</i> to the treasure of the house of Jehovah through Jehiel the Gershonite.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Then the people rejoiced because they offered willingly; for with <i>their</i> whole heart they offered willingly to Jehovah. And David the king also rejoiced with great joy.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And David blessed Jehovah in the sight of all the assembly. And David said, You are blessed, O Jehovah, God of Israel, our Father, from eternity to eternity.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Yours, O Jehovah, is the greatness and the power and the splendor and the victory and the majesty, indeed all that is in heaven and on earth; Yours, O Jehovah, is the kingdom, and You are exalted as Head over all.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Both riches and glory <i>proceed</i> from You, and You rule over all. In Your hand are power and might, and it is in Your hand to make great and to give strength to all.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Now therefore, our God, we thank You and praise Your glorious name.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> But who am I, and who are my people, that we should have strength to offer so willingly in this way? For all things are from You, and from Your hand we have given to You.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> For we are strangers before You and sojourners, as were all our fathers; our days upon earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> O Jehovah our God, as for all this abundance that we have prepared for building You a house for Your holy name, it is from Your hand, and all is Yours.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> I know also, O my God, that You try the heart and take pleasure in uprightness. I, in the uprightness of my heart, have offered willingly all these things; and now I have seen with joy Your people, who are present here, offering willingly to You.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of Your people’s heart and establish their heart toward You.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And to Solomon my son give a wholeness of heart to keep Your commandments, Your testimonies, and Your statutes, and to do all and build the palace for which I have prepared <i>these things.</i><br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Then David said to all the assembly, Bless Jehovah your God. And all the assembly blessed Jehovah, the God of their fathers; and they bowed down and paid homage to Jehovah and the king.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And they offered sacrifices to Jehovah and offered up burnt offerings to Jehovah on the next day — one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, one thousand lambs, with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> And they ate and drank before Jehovah on that day with great joy. And they made Solomon the son of David king a second time and anointed him as ruler for Jehovah, and Zadok as priest.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And Solomon sat upon the throne of Jehovah as king in place of David his father and prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> And all the leaders and mighty men and also all the sons of King David submitted themselves to Solomon the king.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> And Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel and bestowed upon him a royal majesty that had never been on any king before him over Israel.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> And the time which he reigned over Israel was forty years; in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> And David died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> And the acts of David the king, the first and the last, are there written in the chronicles of Samuel the seer and in the chronicles of Nathan the prophet and in the chronicles of Gad the seer,<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> With all his reign and his might and the times that befell him and Israel and all the kingdoms of the lands.<br>
