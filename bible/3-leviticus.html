										<h2>Leviticus</h2>

										<h4 id="leviticus-1">1</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Then Jehovah called to Moses and spoke to him out of the Tent of Meeting, saying,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, When any one of you presents an offering to Jehovah, you shall present your offering from the cattle, of the herd or of the flock.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall present it, a male without blemish; he shall present it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, that he may be accepted before Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And he shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted for him, to make expiation for him.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And he shall slaughter the young bull before Jehovah; and Aaron’s sons the priests shall present the blood and sprinkle the blood on and around the altar that is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And he shall skin the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar and arrange the wood in order on the fire.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, the head, and the fat in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar;<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> But its inward parts and its legs he shall wash with water. Then the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, as a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And if his offering is from the flock, of the sheep or of the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall present it, a male without blemish.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward before Jehovah, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle its blood on and around the altar.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And he shall cut it into its pieces with its head and its fat, and the priest shall arrange them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar;<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> But the inward parts and the legs he shall wash with water. Then the priest shall present the whole and burn <i>it</i> on the altar; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And if his offering to Jehovah is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall present his offering of turtledoves or of young pigeons.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And the priest shall present it at the altar and wring off its head and burn <i>it</i> on the altar; and its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And he shall take away its crop with its feathers and cast it beside the altar toward the east, in the place of the ashes.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Then he shall tear it open by its wings without dividing <i>it,</i> and the priest shall burn it on the altar on the wood that is on the fire; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="leviticus-2">2</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> And when anyone presents an offering of a meal offering to Jehovah, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Then he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests, and he shall take from it his handful of its fine flour and of its oil with all its frankincense. And the priest shall burn <i>it</i> <i>as</i> its memorial portion on the altar, an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And what is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; it is <i>a thing</i> most holy of Jehovah’s offerings by fire.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And when you present an offering of a meal offering baked in the oven, <i>it shall be</i> of fine flour, unleavened cakes mingled with oil or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And if your offering is a meal offering <i>baked</i> on a flat plate, it shall be of fine flour mingled with oil, unleavened.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> You shall break it in pieces and pour oil on it; it is a meal offering.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And if your offering is a meal offering <i>made</i> in a pot, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And you shall bring to Jehovah the meal offering that is made of these things and present it to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And the priest shall take up from the meal offering its memorial portion and shall burn <i>it</i> on the altar, an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And that which is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; it is a thing most holy of Jehovah’s offerings by fire.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> No meal offering that you present to Jehovah shall be made with leaven, for you shall not burn any leaven or any honey as an offering by fire to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> You may present them to Jehovah, as an offering of firstfruits, but they shall not be offered up for a satisfying fragrance on the altar.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And every offering of your meal offering you shall season with salt, and you shall not omit the salt of the covenant of your God from your meal offering; with all your offerings you shall present salt.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And if you present a meal offering of firstfruits to Jehovah, you shall present for the meal offering of your firstfruits new grain roasted with fire, crushed grain of the fresh ear.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And you shall put oil on it and place frankincense on it; it is a meal offering.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And the priest shall burn <i>as</i> its memorial portion some of its crushed grain and some of its oil, with all its frankincense, as an offering by fire to Jehovah.<br>
										</p>

									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="leviticus-3">3</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> And if his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings, if he presents <i>it</i> from the herd, whether male or female, he shall present it without blemish before Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood on and around the altar.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And from the sacrifice of peace offerings he shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah, the fat that covers the inward parts and all the fat that is on the inward parts;<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is on the loins; and the appendage on the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire; it is an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to Jehovah is from the flock, he shall present it, male or female, without blemish.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> If he presents a lamb for his offering, then he shall present it before Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it before the Tent of Meeting, and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle its blood on and around the altar.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And from the sacrifice of peace offerings he shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah, its fat, the entire fat tail which he shall remove close to the backbone, and the fat that covers the inward parts and all the fat that is on the inward parts;<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is on the loins; and the appendage on the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And the priest shall burn it on the altar; it is the food of the offering by fire to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And if his offering is a goat, then he shall present it before Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And he shall lay his hand on its head and slaughter it before the Tent of Meeting, and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle its blood on and around the altar.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And from it he shall present his offering, as an offering by fire to Jehovah, the fat that covers the inward parts and all the fat that is on the inward parts;<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is on the loins; and the appendage on the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And the priest shall burn them on the altar; it is the food of the offering by fire for a satisfying fragrance; all the fat is Jehovah’s.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places that you shall not eat any fat or any blood.<br>
										</p>

									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="leviticus-4">4</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If anyone sins without intent, in any of the things which Jehovah has commanded not to be done, and does any one of them,<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> If the anointed priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him present a bull of the herd without blemish to Jehovah for a sin offering for his sin that he committed.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And he shall bring the bull to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting before Jehovah, and he shall lay his hand on the head of the bull and slaughter the bull before Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And the anointed priest shall take some of the blood of the bull and bring it into the Tent of Meeting,<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before Jehovah in front of the veil of the sanctuary.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense before Jehovah, which is in the Tent of Meeting; and all <i>the rest of</i> the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And all the fat of the bull of the sin offering he shall take off from it: the fat that covers the inward parts and all the fat that is upon the inward parts,<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the appendage upon the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys,<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> As it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And the skin of the bull and all its flesh with its head and with its legs, and <i>the rest of</i> its inward parts and its dung,<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> That is, all <i>the rest of</i> the bull he shall bring out to a clean place outside the camp, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Now if the whole assembly of Israel errs, and the matter escapes the notice of the congregation, and they have done any of the things which Jehovah commanded not to be done and become guilty,<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And when the sin which they have committed becomes known, the congregation shall present a bull of the herd for a sin offering and bring it before the Tent of Meeting.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And the elders of the assembly shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before Jehovah, and one shall slaughter the bull before Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And the anointed priest shall bring some of the blood of the bull to the Tent of Meeting,<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle <i>it</i> seven times before Jehovah in front of the veil.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> And some of the blood he shall put upon the horns of the altar which is before Jehovah, that is, in the Tent of Meeting; and all <i>the rest of</i> the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And all its fat he shall take off from it and burn <i>it</i> on the altar.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Thus shall he do with the bull; just as he did with the bull of the sin offering, so shall he do with this. And the priest shall make expiation for them, and they will be forgiven.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And he shall bring the bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the congregation.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> When a ruler sins and does without intent any one of all the things which Jehovah his God has commanded not to be done and becomes guilty,<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> If his sin in which he has sinned is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a male goat, without blemish.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before Jehovah; it is a sin offering.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put <i>it</i> on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and <i>the rest of</i> its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> And all its fat he shall burn on the altar, like the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. And the priest shall make expiation for him on account of his sin, and he will be forgiven.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> And if any one of the common people sins without intent by doing any one of the things which Jehovah has commanded not to be done and becomes guilty,<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> If his sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a female goat, without blemish, for his sin which he has committed.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> And the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put <i>it</i> on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and all <i>the rest of</i> its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> And all its fat he shall remove, just as the fat is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn <i>it</i> on the altar for a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah. And the priest shall make expiation for him, and he will be forgiven.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> And if he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring it, a female without blemish.<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it for a sin offering in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering.<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put <i>it</i> on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and all <i>the rest of</i> its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.<br>
											 <sup>35</sup> And all its fat he shall remove, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar upon Jehovah’s offerings by fire. And the priest shall make expiation for him concerning his sin that he has committed, and he will be forgiven.<br>

										<h4 id="leviticus-5">5</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> And if anyone sins when he hears the voice of adjuration and he is a witness, either seeing or knowing <i>about a matter,</i> if he does not speak up, then he shall bear his iniquity.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Or if anyone touches any unclean thing, whether the carcass of an unclean animal or the carcass of unclean cattle or the carcass of unclean swarming things, and it escapes his <i>notice,</i> and he is unclean, then he will be guilty.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Or if he touches the uncleanness of man, whatever his uncleanness is with which he becomes unclean, and it escapes his <i>notice,</i> when he comes to know <i>it,</i> then he will be guilty.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Or if anyone swears rashly with his lips to do evil or to do good, whatever it is that a man utters rashly with an oath, and it escapes his <i>notice,</i> when he comes to know <i>it,</i> then he shall be guilty in one of these things.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And when he is guilty in one of these things, he shall confess that in which he has sinned;<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And he shall bring his trespass offering to Jehovah for his sin which he has committed, a female from the flock, a sheep or a goat, as a sin offering; and the priest shall make expiation for him on account of his sin.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring <i>as</i> his trespass offering to Jehovah for that in which he has sinned two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall present first that which is for the sin offering; and the priest shall wring off its head at the front of its neck but shall not sever <i>it;</i><br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And he shall offer the second as a burnt offering according to the ordinance. And the priest shall make expiation for him on account of his sin which he has committed, and he will be forgiven.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he shall bring <i>as</i> his offering for that which he has sinned, the tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it nor put any frankincense upon it, for it is a sin offering.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take a handful of it as its memorial portion and burn <i>it</i> on the altar, upon Jehovah’s offerings by fire; it is a sin offering.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And the priest shall make expiation for him concerning his sin that he has committed in any one of these things, and he will be forgiven. And <i>the</i> <i>rest</i> shall be the priest’s, like the meal offering.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> If anyone acts unfaithfully and sins without intent in the holy things of Jehovah, then he shall bring his trespass offering to Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock according to your valuation in silver by shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And he shall make restitution for the holy thing in which he has sinned, and he shall add to it a fifth part of it and give it to the priest. And the priest shall make expiation for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and he will be forgiven.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And if anyone sins and does any one of the things which Jehovah has commanded not to be done, though he did not know, he is still guilty and shall bear his iniquity.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> And he shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish out of the flock according to your valuation for a trespass offering. And the priest shall make expiation for him concerning the matter in which he erred without intent and did not know, and he will be forgiven.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> It is a trespass offering; he is certainly guilty before Jehovah.<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> If anyone sins and acts unfaithfully against Jehovah and deceives his associate in regard to a deposit or a security, or by robbery, or has extorted from his associate,<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Or has found a lost item and lied about it, if he has sworn falsely in any one of all these things a man may do, and sins thereby;<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Then if he has sinned and is guilty, he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he got by extortion, or the deposit which was entrusted to him, or the lost item which he found,<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Or anything about which he has sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in full, and shall add to it a fifth part of it. He shall give it to the one to whom it belongs, on the day he is found guilty.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And he shall bring to Jehovah his trespass offering, a ram without blemish out of the flock according to your valuation for a trespass offering; to the priest <i>he shall bring it.</i><br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And the priest shall make expiation for him before Jehovah, and he will be forgiven for any of the things which he may have done so as to be guilty.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering shall be on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen trousers he shall put on his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes to which the fire has consumed the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it; it must not go out. And the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and he shall lay the burnt offering in order upon it and shall burn the fat of the peace offerings on it.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And this is the law of the meal offering: The sons of Aaron shall present it before Jehovah before the altar.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And one shall take up from it his handful of the fine flour of the meal offering and of its oil and all the frankincense which is on the meal offering, and he shall burn <i>it</i> on the altar for a satisfying fragrance as its memorial portion to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And what is left of it Aaron and his sons may eat; it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the Tent of Meeting they shall eat it.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of My offerings by fire; it is most holy, like the sin offering and like the trespass offering.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations from Jehovah’s offerings by fire; whoever touches them shall be holy.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall present to Jehovah in the day when he is anointed: the tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a continual meal offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> On a flat plate it shall be prepared with oil; when it is mixed, you shall bring it; as a meal offering of baked pieces you shall present <i>it</i> as a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> And the priest anointed to be in his place from among his sons shall prepare it. It shall be a perpetual statute; it shall be wholly burned to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly burned; it must not be eaten.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered the sin offering shall be slaughtered before Jehovah; it is most holy.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. In a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the Tent of Meeting.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> Whatever touches its flesh shall be holy. And when any of its blood splashes on a garment, you shall wash whatever was splashed in a holy place.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken; and if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, it shall be scoured and rinsed in water.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> Every male among the priests may eat of it; it is most holy.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> And any sin offering of which some of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to make expiation in the Holy Place shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire.<br>

										<h4 id="leviticus-7">7</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> And this is the law of the trespass offering; it is most holy;<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> In the place where they slaughter the burnt offering they shall slaughter the trespass offering, and its blood he shall sprinkle on and around the altar.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And he shall present from it all its fat: the fat tail, and the fat that covers the inward parts,<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the appendage upon the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And the priest shall burn them on the altar as an offering by fire to Jehovah; it is a trespass offering.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Every male among the priests may eat of it; it shall be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> The trespass offering is like the sin offering; there is one law for them: The priest who makes expiation with it shall have it.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And the priest who presents anyone’s burnt offering, that priest shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has presented.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And every meal offering that is baked in an oven and everything that is made in a pot or on a flat plate shall belong to the priest who presents it.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And every <i>other</i> meal offering, mingled with oil or dry, shall be for all the sons of Aaron, to each alike.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Now this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings that one shall present to Jehovah:<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> If he presents it for a thanksgiving, then he shall present with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil and unleavened wafers anointed with oil and saturated cakes of fine flour mingled with oil.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> With cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering with the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And from it he shall present one out of each offering as a heave offering to Jehovah; it shall belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he presents his sacrifice, and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten;<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> But what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten at all on the third day, it will not be accepted, neither will it be reckoned to the one who presents it; it will be an abomination, and the person who eats of it shall bear his own iniquity.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. And as for <i>other</i> flesh, anyone who is clean may eat <i>such</i> flesh.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> But the person who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which belong to Jehovah, with his uncleanness upon him, that person shall be cut off from his people.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And when anyone touches any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man or an unclean beast or any unclean abomination, and eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which belong to Jehovah, that person shall be cut off from his people.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> Speak to the children of Israel, saying, You shall not eat any fat of an ox or of a sheep or of a goat.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> And the fat of <i>an animal</i> that dies and the fat of <i>an animal</i> which is torn <i>by beasts</i> may be put to any <i>other</i> use, but you shall by no means eat it.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> For whoever eats the fat of a beast from which someone presents an offering by fire to Jehovah, indeed the person who eats it shall be cut off from his people.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> And you shall not eat any blood, either of bird or of beast, in any of your dwelling places.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> Any person who eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> Speak to the children of Israel, saying, He who presents the sacrifice of his peace offerings to Jehovah shall bring his offering to Jehovah out of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> His own hands shall bring Jehovah’s offerings by fire; the fat with the breast he shall bring, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> And the priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall be for Aaron and for his sons.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> And the right thigh you shall give to the priest for a heave offering out of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> The one among the sons of Aaron who presents the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh as <i>his</i> portion.<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> For the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering I have taken from the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons for a perpetual statute <i>to be observed</i> by the children of Israel.<br>
											 <sup>35</sup> This is the anointing <i>portion</i> of Aaron and the anointing <i>portion</i> of his sons, from Jehovah’s offerings by fire, in the day when he presented them to serve Jehovah as priests,<br>
											 <sup>36</sup> Which Jehovah commanded to be given them from the children of Israel in the day that He anointed them. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout their generations.<br>
											 <sup>37</sup> This is the law of the burnt offering <i>and</i> of the meal offering and of the sin offering and of the trespass offering and of the consecration and of the sacrifice of peace offerings,<br>
											 <sup>38</sup> Which Jehovah commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day that He commanded the children of Israel to present their offerings to Jehovah in the wilderness of Sinai.<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread;<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And gather all the assembly at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And Moses did just as Jehovah had commanded him, and the assembly was gathered at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And Moses said to the assembly, This is what Jehovah has commanded to be done.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And Moses brought Aaron and his sons near and washed them with water.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And he put the tunic upon him and girded him with the girding sash and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and with it he bound <i>it</i> to him.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And he placed the breastplate upon him, and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And he placed the turban on his head, and on the turban, on its front, he placed the golden plate, the holy crown, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and sanctified them.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him, to sanctify him.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And Moses brought Aaron’s sons near, and clothed them with tunics and girded them with girding sashes and bound high hats on them, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And Moses slaughtered <i>it</i> and took the blood and put <i>some of it</i> on and around the horns of the altar with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out <i>the rest of</i> the blood at the base of the altar and sanctified it, to make expiation for it.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And he took all the fat that was on the inward parts and the appendage of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses burned <i>them</i> on the altar.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> But the bull and its skin and its flesh and its dung he burned with fire outside the camp, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> And he presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And Moses slaughtered <i>it</i> and sprinkled the blood on and around the altar.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> And he cut the ram into its pieces, and Moses burned the head and the pieces and the fat.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And the inward parts and the legs he washed with water, and Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a satisfying fragrance; it was an offering by fire to Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> And he presented the other ram, the ram of consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And Moses slaughtered <i>it</i> and took some of its blood and put <i>it</i> on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> And he brought Aaron’s sons near, and Moses put some of the blood on the lobe of their right ear and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot; and Moses sprinkled <i>the rest of</i> the blood on and around the altar.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> And he took the fat, that is, the fat tail and all the fat that was on the inward parts, and the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh;<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> And from the basket of unleavened bread that was before Jehovah, he took one unleavened cake and one cake of oiled bread and one wafer, and placed <i>them</i> on the fat portions and on the right thigh.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> And he put all <i>these</i> in the palms of Aaron and in the palms of his sons, and he waved them as a wave offering before Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> And Moses took them from their palms and burned <i>them</i> on the altar upon the burnt offering. They were an <i>offering</i> of consecration for a satisfying fragrance; it was an offering by fire to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> And Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering before Jehovah; it was Moses’ portion of the ram of consecration, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> And Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled <i>it</i> on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons and on his sons’ garments with him; and he sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of consecration, just as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> And what is left of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire.<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> And you shall not go out from the entrance of the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your consecration are fulfilled, for it will take seven days to consecrate you.<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> As has been done this day, so Jehovah has commanded to do, to make expiation for you.<br>
											 <sup>35</sup> And at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall stay day and night seven days, and keep the charge of Jehovah, that you may not die; for so I have been commanded.<br>

										<h4 id="leviticus-9">9</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Now on the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel;<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And he said to Aaron, Take for yourself a calf of the herd for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and present <i>them</i> before Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Then to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old without blemish, for a burnt offering;<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and a meal offering mingled with oil; for today Jehovah will appear to you.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> So they brought what Moses had commanded before the Tent of Meeting, and all the assembly came near and stood before Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And Moses said, This is what Jehovah has commanded you to do, and the glory of Jehovah shall appear to you.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Then Moses said to Aaron, Come near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make expiation for yourself and for the people; and make the offering of the people and make expiation for them, just as Jehovah has commanded.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> So Aaron came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put <i>it</i> on the horns of the altar, and <i>the rest of</i> the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> But the fat and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Then he slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him, and he sprinkled it on and around the altar.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And they handed the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burned <i>them</i> on the altar.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And he washed the inward parts and the legs and burned <i>them</i> upon the burnt offering on the altar.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> Then he presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people and slaughtered it and offered it for sin, like the first.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And he presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Then he presented the meal offering and filled his hand with some of it and burned <i>it</i> on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him, which he sprinkled on and around the altar.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And the fat portions of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and <i>the fat</i> which covers <i>the inward parts</i> and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver —<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> These fat portions they then put on the breasts; and he burned the fat portions on the altar.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before Jehovah, just as Moses had commanded.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting. And they came out and blessed the people; and the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the people.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Then fire came forth from before Jehovah and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw <i>it,</i> they gave a ringing shout and fell on their faces.<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire in them and laid incense on it, and they presented strange fire before Jehovah, which He had not commanded them.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed them, and they died before Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Then Moses said to Aaron, This is what Jehovah spoke, saying,In those who come near to Me I will be sanctified, / And before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron was silent.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near; carry your brothers from before the sanctuary to the outside of the camp.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> So they came near and carried them in their tunics to the outside of the camp, just as Moses had said.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, Do not dishevel the hair of your heads, and do not tear your garments, that you may not die and that He may not be angry with all the assembly. But let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, weep for the burning which Jehovah has kindled.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And you shall not go out from the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Aaron, saying,<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Drink no wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you come into the Tent of Meeting, that you may not die; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations,<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Both to make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah has spoken to them through Moses.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Then Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, Take the meal offering which remains of Jehovah’s offerings by fire, and eat it unleavened beside the altar; for it is most holy.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons’ due of Jehovah’s offerings by fire; for so I have been commanded.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you; for they have been given as your due and your sons’ due out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> The thigh of the heave offering and the breast of the wave offering they shall bring with the offerings by fire of the fat portions to wave as a wave offering before Jehovah, and it shall become a perpetual statute for you and for your sons with you, just as Jehovah has commanded.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Then Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, but it had already been burned. So he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary? For it is most holy, and He gave it to you to bear the iniquity of the assembly, to make expiation for them before Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Now its blood was not brought inside, into the sanctuary; you should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, just as I commanded.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> But Aaron spoke to Moses, See, today they have presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before Jehovah, and such things as these have befallen me! And if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been good in the sight of Jehovah?<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> And when Moses heard <i>that,</i> it seemed good in his sight.<br>

											 <sup>3</sup> Whatever has a divided hoof, that is, has <i>its</i> hoof split in two, <i>and</i> chews the cud among the beasts, that you may eat.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> However these you shall not eat: of those that <i>only</i> chew the cud or of those that <i>only</i> have a divided hoof: the camel, for though it chews the cud, it does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean to you.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And the hyrax, for though it chews the cud, it does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean to you.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And the hare, for though it chews the cud, it does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean to you.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And the pig, for though it has a divided hoof, that is, it has <i>its</i> hoof split in two, it does not chew the cud; it is unclean to you.<br>

											 <sup>22</sup> These of them you may eat: the swarming locust of every kind and the swallowing locust of every kind and the cricket of every kind and the grasshopper of every kind.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> But all <i>the other</i> flying insects which have four feet are an abomination to you.<br>

											 <sup>28</sup> And the one who carries their carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> And these are unclean to you among the swarming things that swarm on the earth: the weasel and the mouse and the great lizard of every kind,<br>

											 <sup>31</sup> These are unclean to you among all the swarming things; whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> And anything on which one of them may fall when they are dead shall be unclean, whether it is any article of wood or clothing or skin or sackcloth; any article which is used for any work must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening; then it shall be clean.<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> And any earthen vessel into which any of them falls, whatever is in it shall be unclean, and the vessel you shall break.<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> Any food that could be eaten shall be unclean if water <i>from such a vessel</i> comes upon it, and any liquid that may be drunk shall be unclean <i>if it was</i> in any <i>such</i> vessel.<br>
											 <sup>35</sup> And everything on which part of their carcass falls shall be unclean — an oven or a stove shall be broken in pieces; they are unclean and shall continue to be unclean to you.<br>
											 <sup>36</sup> Nevertheless a spring or a cistern collecting water shall be clean, but whatever touches their carcass shall be unclean.<br>
											 <sup>37</sup> And if any part of their carcass falls on any seed for sowing, which is to be sown, it is clean.<br>

											 <sup>41</sup> Now every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten.<br>
											 <sup>42</sup> Whatever goes on <i>its</i> stomach and whatever goes on all fours, or whatever has many feet, even all the swarming things that swarm on the earth, you shall not eat them, for they are an abomination.<br>
											 <sup>43</sup> You shall not make yourselves abominable with any swarming thing that swarms, nor shall you make yourselves unclean with them, and so become defiled by them.<br>
											 <sup>44</sup> For I am Jehovah your God. Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy. And you shall not defile yourselves with any of the swarming things that move upon the earth.<br>
											 <sup>45</sup> For I am Jehovah, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God; you shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.<br>
											 <sup>46</sup> This is the law of the beast and of the bird, and of every living animal that moves in the waters, and of every creature that swarms upon the earth;<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> When a man has a swelling or an eruption or a bright spot on the skin of his body, and it becomes an infection of leprosy on the skin of his body, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And the priest shall look at the infection in the skin of the body; and if the hair in the infection has turned white and the appearance of the infection is deeper than the skin of his body, it is the infection of leprosy. When the priest has looked at him, he shall pronounce him unclean.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And if the bright spot is white on the skin of his body, and its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and the hair on it has not turned white, then the priest shall isolate <i>the one who has</i> the infection seven days.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And the priest shall look at him on the seventh day; and if in his eyes the infection remains, <i>and</i> the infection has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall isolate him seven more days.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And the priest shall look at him again on the seventh day; and if the infection has faded, and the infection has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is <i>only</i> a scab. And he shall wash his clothes and be clean.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> But if the scab spreads further on the skin after he has showed himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself again to the priest.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And the priest shall look; and if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> When the infection of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest;<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And the priest shall look; and if there is a white swelling in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is living raw flesh in the swelling,<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> It is a chronic leprosy on the skin of his body; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. He shall not isolate him, for he is unclean.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And if the leprosy breaks out further on the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of <i>the one who has</i> the infection, from his head even to his feet, as far as the priest can see,<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Then the priest shall look; and if the leprosy has covered all his body, he shall pronounce <i>him who has</i> the infection clean. It has all turned white; he is clean.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> But whenever raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And the priest shall look at the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean. The raw flesh is unclean; it is leprosy.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> But if the raw flesh again turns white, then he shall come to the priest.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And the priest shall look at him; and if the infection has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce <i>him who has</i> the infection clean; he is clean.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> And when the body has a boil on its skin, and it has healed,<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And in the place of the boil there is a white swelling or a reddish-white bright spot, then it shall be shown to the priest.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> And the priest shall look; and if its appearance is below <i>the surface of</i> the skin, and the hair on it has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is the infection of leprosy; it has broken out in the boil.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> But if the priest looks at it, and if there is no white hair in it, and it is not below <i>the surface of</i> the skin, but it has faded, then the priest shall isolate him seven days.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> And if it spreads further in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> But if the bright spot remains in its place and does not spread, it is <i>only</i> the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Or when the flesh has on its skin a burn by fire, and the raw <i>flesh</i> of the burn becomes a bright spot, reddish-white or white,<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> Then the priest shall look at it; and if the hair in the bright spot has turned white, and its appearance is deeper than the skin, it is leprosy. It has broken out in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the infection of leprosy.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> But if the priest looks at it, and if there is no white hair in the bright spot, and it is not below <i>the surface of</i> the skin, but it has faded, then the priest shall isolate him seven days.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> And the priest shall look at him on the seventh day. If it spreads further in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the infection of leprosy.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> And if the bright spot remains in its place, and it has not spread in the skin, but it has faded, it is the swelling from the burn; and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is <i>only</i> the scar of the burning.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> And if a man or woman has an infection on the head or on the beard,<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> Then the priest shall look at the infection; and if its appearance is deeper than the skin, and there is in it thin yellowish hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a scale; it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> And if the priest looks at the infection of the scale, and if its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall isolate <i>the one who has</i> the infection of the scale seven days.<br>

											 <sup>33</sup> Then he shall shave himself, but the scale he shall not shave. And the priest shall isolate <i>the one who has</i> the scale seven days more.<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> And on the seventh day the priest shall look at the scale; and if the scale has not spread in the skin, and its appearance is not deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. And he shall wash his clothes and be clean.<br>
											 <sup>35</sup> But if the scale spreads further in the skin after his cleansing,<br>
											 <sup>36</sup> Then the priest shall look at him; and if the scale has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellowish hair; he is unclean.<br>
											 <sup>37</sup> But if, in the priest’s eyes, the scale has remained, and black hair has grown up in it, the scale is healed; he is clean. And the priest shall pronounce him clean.<br>
											 <sup>38</sup> And when a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of their body, white bright spots,<br>
											 <sup>39</sup> Then the priest shall look; and if the bright spots on the skin of their body are a dull white, it is a rash that has broken out on the skin; he is clean.<br>
											 <sup>40</sup> And if a man loses the hair of his head, he is bald; he is clean.<br>
											 <sup>41</sup> And if he loses hair from his forehead and his temples, he is bald on the forehead; he is clean.<br>
											 <sup>42</sup> But if on the bald head or the bald forehead there is a reddish-white infection, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or on his bald forehead.<br>
											 <sup>43</sup> Then the priest shall look at him; and if the swelling of the infection is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body,<br>
											 <sup>44</sup> He is a leprous man; he is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his infection is on his head.<br>
											 <sup>45</sup> And as for the leper in whom the infection is, his clothes shall be torn, and the hair of his head shall be let loose, and he shall cover his upper lip and cry, Unclean, unclean!<br>
											 <sup>46</sup> He shall be unclean all the days during which the infection is in him; he is unclean. He shall live alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp.<br>
											 <sup>47</sup> The garment also that the infection of leprosy is in, whether it is a woolen garment or a linen garment,<br>
											 <sup>48</sup> Whether it is in warp or woof, of linen or of wool, whether in a skin or in anything made of skin,<br>
											 <sup>49</sup> If the infection is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the skin, or in the warp or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is the infection of leprosy and shall be shown to the priest.<br>
											 <sup>50</sup> And the priest shall look at the infection and isolate <i>the article which has</i> the infection for seven days.<br>
											 <sup>51</sup> Then he shall look at the infection on the seventh day. If the infection has spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever the purpose the skin is used for, the infection is a malignant leprosy; it is unclean.<br>
											 <sup>52</sup> And he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in wool or in linen, or anything of skin in which the infection occurs, for it is a malignant leprosy; it shall be burned in the fire.<br>
											 <sup>53</sup> And if the priest shall look, and if the infection has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in anything of skin,<br>
											 <sup>54</sup> Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which the infection is; and he shall isolate it for seven more days.<br>
											 <sup>55</sup> And after <i>the article with</i> the infection has been washed, the priest shall look at <i>it;</i> and if the infection has not changed its appearance, even <i>though</i> the infection has not spread, it is unclean. You shall burn it in the fire; it is a leprous decay, whether the bareness is on the inside or on the outside.<br>
											 <sup>56</sup> And if the priest looks, and if the infection has faded after it was washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment or out of the skin, whether from the warp or from the woof.<br>
											 <sup>57</sup> But if it appears again in the garment, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is spreading. You shall burn the article that the infection is in, in the fire.<br>
											 <sup>58</sup> And the garment, whether the warp or the woof, or any article of skin, which you shall wash, if the infection has departed from them, shall be washed a second time and shall be clean.<br>
											 <sup>59</sup> This is the law of the infection of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp or in the woof, or anything of skin, for pronouncing it clean or for pronouncing it unclean.<br>

											 <sup>4</sup> Then the priest shall command that two living clean birds and cedar wood and scarlet <i>strands</i> and hyssop be taken for the one who is to be cleansed.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And the priest shall command that one of the birds be slaughtered in an earthen vessel over running water.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> As for the living bird, he shall take it and the cedar wood and the scarlet <i>strands</i> and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was slaughtered over the running water.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And he shall sprinkle <i>it</i> on the one who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times and shall pronounce him clean. Then he shall let the living bird go into the open field.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And the one who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and bathe in water, and he shall be clean. And after that he may come into the camp, but he shall dwell outside his tent seven days.<br>

											 <sup>13</sup> Then he shall slaughter the male lamb in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary; for the trespass offering, like the sin offering, is the priest’s; it is most holy.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put <i>it</i> on the lobe of the right ear of the one who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.<br>

											 <sup>43</sup> And if the infection returns and breaks out in the house after he has taken out the stones and after he has scraped the house and after it has been replastered,<br>
											 <sup>44</sup> Then the priest shall come in and look; and if the infection has spread in the house, it is a malignant leprosy in the house; it is unclean.<br>
											 <sup>45</sup> And he shall break down the house, its stones and its timber and all the plaster of the house, and he shall bring <i>them</i> outside the city into an unclean place.<br>
											 <sup>46</sup> Moreover, whoever goes into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.<br>

											 <sup>19</sup> And he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times; thus he will cleanse it and sanctify it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> And when he has finished making expiation for the Holy <i>of Holies</i> and the Tent of Meeting and the altar, he shall present the live goat.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them on the head of the goat, and shall send <i>it</i> away into the wilderness by means of the man who has been appointed.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> Thus the goat shall bear away all their iniquities on itself to a solitary land, and he shall let the goat go in the wilderness.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting and take off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the Holy <i>of Holies,</i> and leave them there.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> And he shall bathe his body in water in a holy place and put on his garments. Then he shall come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, and make expiation for himself and for the people.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> And the fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> And he who lets the goat go for Azazel shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> And the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make expiation in the Holy <i>of Holies,</i> shall be carried forth outside the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins and their flesh and their dung.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> And <i>this</i> shall become a perpetual statute for you; in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month you shall afflict your souls and not do any work, neither the native nor the sojourner who sojourns among you.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> For on this day expiation shall be made for you, in order to cleanse you; from all your sins you shall be clean before Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> It is a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you shall afflict your souls. It shall be a perpetual statute.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> And the priest who is anointed and who is consecrated to serve as a priest in his father’s place shall make expiation; thus he shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments.<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> And he shall make expiation for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make expiation for the Tent of Meeting and for the altar, and he shall make expiation for the priests and for all the people of the congregation.<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> And this shall become a perpetual statute for you, in order to make expiation for the children of Israel because of all their sins, once in the year. And just as Jehovah had commanded Moses, <i>so</i> he did.<br>

											 <sup>3</sup> Anyone of the house of Israel who slaughters an ox or a sheep or a goat within the camp, or who slaughters <i>it</i> outside the camp,<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And has not brought it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to present <i>it</i> as an offering to Jehovah before the tabernacle of Jehovah, that man shall be accounted as guilty of bloodshed. He has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> <i>This is</i> so that the children of Israel will bring their sacrifices which they sacrifice in the open field, that they will bring them to Jehovah at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to the priest and sacrifice them as sacrifices of peace offerings to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And the priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of Jehovah at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and burn the fat for a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat demons, to whom they prostitute themselves. This shall become a perpetual statute for them throughout their generations.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And you shall say to them, Anyone of the house of Israel or of the sojourners who sojourn among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And does not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to sacrifice it to Jehovah, that man shall be cut off from his people.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And anyone of the house of Israel or of the sojourners who sojourn among them, who eats any blood, I will set My face against that person who eats blood and cut him off from among his people.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you to make expiation for your souls on the altar, for it is the blood, by reason of the life, that makes expiation.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Therefore I said to the children of Israel, No person among you shall eat blood, nor shall any sojourner who sojourns among you eat blood.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And anyone of the children of Israel or of the sojourners who sojourn among them, who in hunting takes an animal or bird that may be eaten, shall pour out its blood and cover it with dust.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> For as to the life of all flesh, its blood is its very life; therefore I have said to the children of Israel, You shall not eat the blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats it shall be cut off.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And every person who eats that which dies of itself or is torn <i>by beasts,</i> whether he is a native or a sojourner, shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening; then he shall be clean.<br>

											 <sup>6</sup> None of you shall approach to any of his close relatives to uncover <i>their</i> nakedness; I am Jehovah.<br>

											 <sup>10</sup> The nakedness of your son’s daughter or of your daughter’s daughter, their nakedness you shall not uncover; for their <i>nakedness</i> is your own nakedness.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> The nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of your father — she is your sister — you shall not uncover her nakedness.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister; she is your father’s flesh.<br>

											 <sup>24</sup> Do not defile yourselves in any of these things, for by all these the nations which I am casting out before you have defiled themselves.<br>

											 <sup>18</sup> You shall not take vengeance nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself; I am Jehovah.<br>

											 <sup>20</sup> And if a man lies down <i>and has</i> sexual relations with a woman who is a slave designated for <i>another</i> man, but not at all redeemed nor given her freedom, there shall be an inquiry; they shall not be put to death, because she was not freed.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And he shall bring his trespass offering to Jehovah, to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, a ram for a trespass offering.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> And the priest shall make expiation for him before Jehovah with the ram of the trespass offering for his sin which he has committed; and the sin which he has committed will be forgiven him.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And when you come into the land and plant all kinds of trees for food, then you shall count their fruit as unharvestable. Three years it shall be unharvestable to you; it shall not be eaten.<br>

											 <sup>29</sup> Do not profane your daughter by making her a harlot, so that the land does not fall to harlotry, and the land become full of wickedness.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> You shall keep My Sabbaths and revere My sanctuary; I am Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> Do not turn to mediums or to spiritists; do not seek after them to be defiled by them; I am Jehovah your God.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> You shall rise up before the grayheaded and honor the face of the old man. And you shall fear your God; I am Jehovah.<br>

											 <sup>12</sup> If there is a man who lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death. They have brought about confusion; their blood shall be upon them.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> If there is a man who lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> If there is a man who takes a wife and her mother, it is wickedness. They shall be burned with fire, both he and they, that there be no wickedness among you.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> If there is a man who lies with a beast, he shall surely be put to death; and you shall slaughter the beast.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> If there is a woman who approaches any beast to lie down with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast. They shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> If there is a man who takes his sister, his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter, and he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness, it is a reproach, and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people. He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> If there is a man who lies with a woman having her sickness, and he uncovers her nakedness, he has laid bare her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood; and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And you shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister nor of your father’s sister, for he has made naked his flesh; they shall bear their iniquity.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> If there is a man who lies with his aunt, he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness. They shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> If there is a man who takes his brother’s wife, it is impurity. He has uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> You shall therefore keep all My statutes and all My ordinances, and do them, so that the land into which I am bringing you to dwell in does not vomit you out.<br>

											 <sup>18</sup> For no one who has a defect shall approach: one who is blind or lame or with a disfigured nose or with an extended <i>limb,</i><br>
											 <sup>19</sup> Or one who has a broken foot or a broken hand,<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Or a hunchback or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye or eczema or scale or crushed testicles.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> No one of the seed of Aaron the priest who has a defect shall come near to present Jehovah’s offerings by fire. He has a defect; he shall not come near to present the food of his God.<br>

											 <sup>17</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>

											 <sup>19</sup> <i>It shall be</i> a male without blemish from the cattle, from the sheep, or from the goats, for you to be accepted.<br>

											 <sup>21</sup> And whoever presents a sacrifice of peace offerings to Jehovah to make a special vow or for a freewill offering, from the herd or from the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish in it.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> You shall not present these to Jehovah: <i>anything</i> blind or injured or maimed or having a suppuration or eczema or scale; nor shall you make an offering by fire from them on the altar to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> An ox or a lamb that has anything superfluous or lacking in its parts, that you may offer for a freewill offering; but it shall not be accepted for a vow.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> And anything <i>with its testicles</i> bruised or crushed or broken or cut, you shall not present to Jehovah; you shall not do <i>this</i> in your land.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> And from the hand of a foreigner you shall not present the food of your God from any of these, because their corruption is in them. There is a blemish in them; they shall not be accepted for you.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother; and from the eighth day and onward it shall be accepted for the offering of an offering by fire to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> But whether cow or sheep, you shall not slaughter both it and its young on one day.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> And when you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Jehovah, you shall sacrifice <i>it</i> so that you may be accepted.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> On the same day it shall be eaten; you shall leave none of it until the morning; I am Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> Therefore you shall keep My commandments and do them; I am Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> And you shall not profane My holy name, but I will be sanctified among the children of Israel; I am Jehovah who sanctifies you,<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, <i>As to</i> the appointed feasts of Jehovah, which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, these are My appointed feasts.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day there is a Sabbath of complete rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work; it is a Sabbath to Jehovah in all your dwelling places.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> These are the appointed feasts of Jehovah, even the holy convocations, which you shall proclaim at their appointed time:<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> In the first month, on the fourteenth <i>day</i> of the month at twilight, is Jehovah’s Passover,<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And on the fifteenth day of this month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to Jehovah; seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no work of labor.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> But you shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah seven days. On the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no work of labor.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land which I am giving you, and reap its harvest, then you shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest;<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah for your acceptance; on the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And on the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And its meal offering shall be two-tenths <i>of an ephah</i> of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering by fire to Jehovah for a satisfying fragrance. And its drink offering shall be of wine, a fourth of a hin.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And you shall eat no bread or parched grain or fresh ears until that same day, until you have brought the offering of your God. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And you shall count for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath; from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering there shall be seven complete Sabbaths.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> You shall count fifty days until the day after the seventh Sabbath; then you shall present a new meal offering to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> You shall bring out of your dwelling places two loaves as a wave offering; they shall be of two tenths <i>of an ephah</i> of fine flour, baked with leaven, as firstfruits to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> And you shall present with the bread seven lambs, a year old without blemish, and one bull of the herd and two rams; they shall be a burnt offering to Jehovah with their meal offering and their drink offerings, an offering by fire for a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And you shall offer one male goat for a sin offering and two male lambs, a year old, for a sacrifice of peace offerings.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave offering before Jehovah with the two lambs; they shall be holy to Jehovah for the priest.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And you shall make a proclamation on that same day; you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no work of labor. It shall be a perpetual statute in all your dwelling places throughout your generations.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely reap the corners of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest; you shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner; I am Jehovah your God.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Speak to the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a complete rest, a memorial <i>commemorated by</i> the blowing <i>of trumpets,</i> a holy convocation.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> You shall do no work of labor, but you shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> And on the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Expiation; you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall afflict your souls and present an offering by fire to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> And you shall do no work on that same day, because it is a Day of Expiation, to make expiation on your behalf before Jehovah your God.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> If there is any person who does not afflict himself on that same day, he shall be cut off from his people.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> And if any person does any work on that same day, I will destroy that person from among his people.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> You shall do no work; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> It shall be to you a Sabbath of complete rest, and you shall afflict your souls; on the ninth day of the month in the evening, from evening to evening, you shall keep your Sabbath.<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> Speak to the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>35</sup> On the first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no work of labor.<br>
											 <sup>36</sup> Seven days you shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah. It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no work of labor.<br>
											 <sup>37</sup> These are the appointed feasts of Jehovah, which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, to present an offering by fire to Jehovah, burnt offerings and meal offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its own day,<br>
											 <sup>38</sup> Besides the Sabbaths of Jehovah and besides your gifts and besides all your vows and besides all your freewill offerings which you give to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>39</sup> Then on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the produce of the land, you shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days; on the first day shall be a complete rest, and on the eighth day shall be a complete rest.<br>
											 <sup>40</sup> And on the first day you shall take for yourselves the product of stately trees, branches of palm trees and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Jehovah your God for seven days.<br>
											 <sup>41</sup> And you shall keep it as a feast to Jehovah seven days in the year. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations; you shall keep it in the seventh month.<br>
											 <sup>42</sup> You shall dwell in booths seven days — all who are native in Israel shall dwell in booths —<br>
											 <sup>43</sup> So that your descendants may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.<br>
											 <sup>44</sup> And Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed feasts of Jehovah.<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Command the children of Israel to bring to you pure oil of beaten olives for the light, to make the lamps burn continually.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Outside the veil of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting Aaron shall maintain it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah continually. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> He shall maintain the lamps in order on the pure lampstand before Jehovah continually.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it; two-tenths <i>of an ephah</i> shall be <i>in</i> each cake.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And you shall set them in two rows, six in a row, on the table of pure <i>gold</i> before Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And you shall put pure frankincense on each row, so that it may be a memorial for the bread, an offering by fire to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Every Sabbath day continually he shall set it in order before Jehovah; it is an everlasting covenant for the children of Israel.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place, for it is most holy to him of Jehovah’s offerings by fire, a perpetual statute.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Now the son of an Israelite woman, who was also the son of an Egyptian man, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelite woman and a certain Israelite struggled together in the camp.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed, and they brought him to Moses. (Now his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And they put him in custody so that it might be declared to them by the mouth of Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Bring forth the one who has cursed outside the camp; and let all who heard <i>him</i> lay their hands on his head, and let all the assembly stone him.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, Anyone who curses his God shall bear his sin.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And the one who blasphemes the name of Jehovah shall surely be put to death; all the assembly shall surely stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And anyone who takes the life of any human being shall surely be put to death.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> And the one who takes the life of a beast shall make restitution for it, life for life.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And anyone who causes an injury to his fellow countryman, as he has done, so shall it be done to him:<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> A fracture for a fracture, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; just as he has caused an injury to a man, so it will be inflicted on him.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And one who kills a beast shall make restitution for it, but one who kills a human being shall be put to death.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> You shall have one judgment for the sojourner as well as for the native, for I am Jehovah your God.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and they brought forth the one who had cursed outside the camp and stoned him with stones. So the children of Israel did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.<br>

										<h4 id="leviticus-25">25</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land which I am giving you, the land shall observe a Sabbath to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its produce;<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> But in the seventh year the land shall have a Sabbath of complete rest, a Sabbath to Jehovah; you shall not sow your field nor prune your vineyard.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> The aftergrowth of your harvest you shall not reap, and the grapes of your unpruned vine you shall not gather; the land shall have a year of complete rest.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And the Sabbath <i>produce</i> of the land shall be for food for you; for you and for your male slaves and for your female slaves, and for your hired servant and for your stranger, who sojourns with you,<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And for your cattle and for the animals that are in your land, shall all its produce be for food.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And you shall count off seven Sabbaths of years to yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of seven Sabbaths of years, that is, forty-nine years.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Then you shall sound aloud the ram’s horn in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month; on the Day of Expiation you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And you shall sanctify the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you; and each of you shall return to his possession, and each of you shall return to his family.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; you shall not sow nor reap its aftergrowth nor gather from its unpruned vines.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its produce out of the field.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> In this year of jubilee each one of you shall return to his possession.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And if you sell anything to your fellow countryman or buy from the hand of your fellow countryman, you shall not wrong one another.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall buy from your fellow countryman; according to the number of crop years <i>remaining</i> he shall sell to you.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> According to the extent of the years you shall increase its price, and according to the fewness of the years you shall diminish its price; for it is the number of crop <i>years</i> that he sells to you.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And you shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am Jehovah your God.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Thus you shall observe My statutes, and you shall keep My ordinances and observe them, so that you dwell securely in the land.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat to be satisfied and dwell securely in it.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> And if you should say, What shall we eat the seventh year if we do not sow or gather in our produce?<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> Then I will command My blessing for you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth produce for three years.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> When you sow in the eighth year you will eat of the old produce until the ninth year; until its produce comes in, you shall eat the old <i>produce.</i><br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity, because the land is Mine; for you are strangers and sojourners with Me.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> And in all the land of your possession you shall provide for the redemption of the land.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> If your brother becomes poor and sells some of his possession, then his redeemer, the nearest relative, shall come and redeem what his brother has sold.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> But if a man does not have anyone to redeem <i>it,</i> but he obtains the means and finds <i>it</i> sufficient to redeem it,<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> Then let him calculate the years since its sale and restore the excess to the man to whom he sold <i>it,</i> and return to his possession.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> But if he has not found sufficient means to restore <i>it</i> for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hand of the one who has purchased it until the year of jubilee; and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> And if anyone sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it until the end of a year from its sale; for a full year he shall have the right of redemption.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> But if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall pass in perpetuity to the one who purchased it throughout his generations; it shall not go out in the jubilee.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> But the houses of the villages which have no wall all around them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country; they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> As for the cities of the Levites, <i>that is,</i> the houses of the cities of their possession, the Levites shall have the permanent right of redemption.<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> And what can be redeemed from the Levites, that is, a house that was sold <i>in</i> a city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession.<br>
											 <sup>35</sup> And if your brother becomes poor, and he is unable to support himself <i>as he lives</i> beside you, then you shall support him, like a stranger and a sojourner, so that he may live beside you.<br>
											 <sup>36</sup> Do not take any interest or gain from him, but fear your God, so that your brother may live beside you.<br>
											 <sup>37</sup> You shall not give him your money at interest nor give him your food for gain.<br>
											 <sup>38</sup> I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, to be your God.<br>
											 <sup>39</sup> And if your brother beside you becomes poor, and he sells himself to you, you shall not make him serve as a slave.<br>
											 <sup>40</sup> He shall be beside you as a hired servant, as a sojourner; he shall serve beside you until the year of jubilee.<br>
											 <sup>41</sup> Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and return to his own family, and he shall return to the possession of his forefathers.<br>
											 <sup>42</sup> For they are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves are sold.<br>
											 <sup>43</sup> You shall not rule over him with severity, but you shall fear your God.<br>
											 <sup>44</sup> And as for your male slaves and female slaves whom you may have, <i>they shall come</i> from the nations that are around you; from them you may buy male slaves and female slaves.<br>
											 <sup>45</sup> Moreover from the children of the strangers who sojourn among you, from them you may buy, and from their families who are with you, which they have begotten in your land; they also may be your possession.<br>
											 <sup>46</sup> And you shall make them an inheritance for your children after you, to receive as a possession; you may use them as permanent slaves. But you shall not rule over your brothers the children of Israel, one over another, with severity.<br>
											 <sup>47</sup> And if a stranger or sojourner with you can afford <i>it,</i> and your brother beside him becomes poor and sells himself to the stranger <i>or</i> sojourner with you, or to the descendants of the stranger’s family;<br>
											 <sup>48</sup> After he has sold himself, he may be redeemed; one of his brothers may redeem him,<br>
											 <sup>49</sup> Or his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him, or any of his close relatives of his family may redeem him; or if he can afford <i>it,</i> he may redeem himself.<br>
											 <sup>50</sup> And he shall reckon with the one who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him until the year of jubilee, and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years. <i>The time</i> he shall be with him shall be <i>calculated</i> like the time of a hired servant.<br>
											 <sup>51</sup> If there are still many years, in proportion to them he shall give back <i>the amount for</i> his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.<br>
											 <sup>52</sup> And if there are only a few years remaining until the year of jubilee, so he shall reckon with him. In proportion to his years he shall give back <i>the amount for</i> his redemption.<br>
											 <sup>53</sup> Like a servant hired year by year he shall be with him; he shall not rule with severity over him in your sight.<br>
											 <sup>54</sup> And if he is not redeemed by these <i>means,</i> then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he and his children with him.<br>
											 <sup>55</sup> For the children of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> You shall not make for yourselves idols, nor shall you raise up for yourselves a graven image or a pillar, nor shall you place a stone figure in your land to bow down to it; for I am Jehovah your God.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> You shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary; I am Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments and do them,<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Then I will give <i>you</i> your rains in their season, and the land will yield its produce, and the trees of the field will yield their fruit.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Indeed your threshing will overtake the vintage, and the vintage will overtake the sowing time. Thus you will eat your bread unto satisfaction and dwell securely in your land.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And I will give <i>you</i> peace in the land, so that you will lie down and no one will make you afraid; and I will cause wild beasts to cease out of the land, and no sword will pass through your land.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And you will chase your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand; and your enemies will fall by the sword before you.<br>

											 <sup>11</sup> And I will set My tabernacle among you; and My soul will not abhor you.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be My people.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt so that <i>you</i> should not be their slaves; and I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk upright.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> But if you will not listen to Me and will not do all these commandments,<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And if you reject My statutes, and if your soul abhors My ordinances so that you will not do all My commandments, so as to break My covenant;<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> I also will do this to you: I will appoint sudden terror over you, even consumption and fever, that will cause the eyes to fail and make the soul to pine away; and you will sow your seed in vain, for your enemies will eat it.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And I will set My face against you, and you will be struck down before your enemies; and those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when no one pursues you.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> And if after these things you will not listen to Me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your sky like iron and your land like bronze,<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> And your strength will be spent in vain, for your land will not yield its produce, nor will the trees of the land yield their fruit.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And if you walk contrary to Me and will not listen to Me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> And I will send wild animals among you, which will bereave you of your children and destroy your cattle and make you few in number, so that your roads will be deserted.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And if by these things you will not be corrected by Me, but walk contrary to Me,<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Then I also will walk contrary to you; and I will strike you, I Myself, seven times for your sins.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> And I will bring a sword upon you that will execute the vengeance of the covenant. And when you gather together within your cities, I will send pestilence among you, and you will be delivered into the hand of the enemy.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven; and they will return your bread by weight, and you will eat and not be satisfied.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> And if in spite of this you will not listen to Me, but walk contrary to Me,<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> Then I will walk contrary to you in wrath; and I will chastise you, I Myself, seven times for your sins.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> And you will eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters you will eat.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> And I will destroy your high places and cut down your altars to the sun and heap up your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols, and My soul will abhor you.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> And I will make your cities a waste and will make your holy places desolate, and I will not smell the savor of your satisfying fragrances.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> And I will make the land desolate, so that your enemies who dwell in it will be astonished at it.<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> You however I will scatter among the nations, and I will unsheathe the sword after you; and your land will become a desolation, and your cities will become a waste.<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths during all the days of desolation while you are in your enemies’ land; then the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths.<br>
											 <sup>35</sup> During all the days of desolation it will have the rest, which it did not have on your Sabbaths when you were dwelling upon it.<br>
											 <sup>36</sup> And as for those who remain among you, I will send faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight; and they will flee as one flees from the sword; and they will fall though no one pursues.<br>
											 <sup>37</sup> And they will stumble over one another, as if <i>fleeing</i> before the sword, though no one pursues; and you will not be able to stand before your enemies.<br>
											 <sup>38</sup> And you will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will consume you.<br>
											 <sup>39</sup> And those who are remaining among you will rot away because of their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also because of the iniquities of their fathers they will rot away with them.<br>
											 <sup>40</sup> But if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, in their unfaithfulness which they committed against Me, and also that they walked contrary to Me,<br>
											 <sup>41</sup> <i>So that</i> I also walked contrary to them and brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and then they accept the punishment of their iniquity;<br>
											 <sup>42</sup> Then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and I will remember also My covenant with Isaac and also My covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.<br>
											 <sup>43</sup> For the land will be abandoned by them and will enjoy its Sabbaths while it is desolate without them. And they will accept the punishment of their iniquity because, even because, they rejected My ordinances, and their soul abhorred My statutes.<br>
											 <sup>44</sup> And yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, nor will I abhor them so as to destroy them utterly and to break My covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God.<br>
											 <sup>45</sup> But for their sakes I will remember the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations so that I might be their God; I am Jehovah.<br>

										<h4 id="leviticus-27">27</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, When a man makes a special vow to Jehovah, it shall be according to your valuation of persons.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> If your valuation is for the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver according to the shekel of the sanctuary.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And if it is for a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And if it is for <i>one aged</i> from five years old even to twenty years old, then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And if it is for <i>one aged</i> from a month old even to five years old, then your valuation for the male shall be five shekels of silver, and for the female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And if it is for <i>one aged</i> from sixty years old and upward, if it is for a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> But if it is for him who is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the means of the one who vowed, the priest shall value him.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And if it is for an animal which may be presented to Jehovah as an offering, anything which may be given to Jehovah shall be holy.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> He may not exchange it or substitute it, either a good one for a bad one or a bad one for a good one; but if he does indeed substitute animal for animal, then both it and its substitute shall be holy.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And if <i>his vow</i> is for any unclean animal, which may not be presented as an offering to Jehovah, then he shall set the animal before the priest,<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad; as you, the priest, value it, so shall it be.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> But if he ever redeems it, then he shall add one-fifth of it to your valuation.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And if anyone consecrates his house to be holy to Jehovah, then the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad; just as the priest values it, so shall it stand.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And if the one who consecrated <i>it</i> redeems his house, then he shall add one-fifth of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall become his.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And if a man consecrates to Jehovah part of a field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seed needed for it: a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> If he consecrates his field from the year of jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> But if he consecrates his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall calculate the money for him according to the years which remain until the year of jubilee, and it shall be deducted from your valuation.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And if the one who consecrated the field ever redeems it, then he shall add one-fifth of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall revert to him.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> But if he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> But the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to Jehovah as a devoted field; its possession shall be the priest’s.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> And if he consecrates to Jehovah a field which he has bought that is not part of the field of his possession,<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> Then the priest shall calculate for him the amount of your valuation until the year of jubilee, and on that day he shall give your valuation as holy to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> In the year of jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom he bought it, even to the one to whom the possession of the land belongs.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> And every valuation of yours shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary. The shekel shall be twenty gerahs.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> However no one shall consecrate the firstborn among animals, which as a firstborn <i>already</i> belongs to Jehovah; whether it is an ox or a sheep, it is Jehovah’s.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> But if <i>it is consecrated from</i> among unclean animals, then he shall ransom it according to your valuation and shall add to it one-fifth of it. And if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> Nevertheless anything which someone devotes to Jehovah out of all that he has, whether a human or an animal or a field of his possession, it shall not be sold or redeemed. Every devoted thing is most holy to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> No human beings who are devoted to destruction shall be ransomed; they shall surely be put to death.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is Jehovah’s; it is holy to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> And if anyone redeems any of his tithe, he shall add to it one-fifth of it.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the shepherd’s rod, the tenth one shall be holy to Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> He shall not search whether it is good or bad, nor shall he substitute it; but if he does substitute it at all, then both it and that for which it is substituted shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> These are the commandments which Jehovah commanded Moses on Mount Sinai for the children of Israel.<br>
