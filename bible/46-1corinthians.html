										<h2>1 Corinthians</h2>


										<h4 id="1corinthians-1">1</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours:<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> I thank my God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus,<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> That in everything you were enriched in Him, in all utterance and all knowledge,<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> So that you do not lack in any gift, eagerly awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Who will also confirm you until the end unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> For it has been made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of the household of Chloe, that there are strifes among you.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> That no one may say that you were baptized into my name.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And I did baptize the household of Stephanas also; beyond that I do not know if I baptized any other.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> For Christ did not send me to baptize but to announce the gospel, not in wisdom of speech that the cross of Christ may not be made void.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> For the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> For it is written, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of those who understand I will set aside.”<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made the wisdom of the world foolish?<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was well pleased through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> For indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom,<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> But we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness,<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> For consider your calling, brothers, that there are not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many wellborn.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> But God has chosen the foolish things of the world that He might shame those who are wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world that He might shame the things that are strong,<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> And the lowborn things of the world and the despised things God has chosen, things which are not, that He might bring to nought the things which are,<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> So that no flesh may boast before God.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption,<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> That as it is written, “He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.” <br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="1corinthians-2">2</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> And I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the mystery of God.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling;<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And my speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> In order that your faith would not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> But we do speak wisdom among those who are full-grown, yet a wisdom not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are being brought to nought;<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> But we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory,<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Which none of the rulers of this age have known; for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> But as it is written, “Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man’s heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him.”<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him? In the same way, the things of God also no one has known except the Spirit of God.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> But we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is from God, that we may know the things which have been graciously given to us by God;<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Which things also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things with spiritual words.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> But the spiritual man discerns all things, but he himself is discerned by no one.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> For who has known the mind of the Lord and will instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ. <br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="1corinthians-3">3</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it. But neither yet now are you able,<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> For you are still fleshly. For if there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man?<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> For when someone says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not men of flesh?<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Ministers through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to each one of them.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> So then neither is he who plants anything nor he who waters, but God who causes the growth.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Now he who plants and he who waters are one, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s cultivated land, God’s building.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it. But let each man take heed how he builds upon it.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> For another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble,<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> The work of each will become manifest; for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one’s work, of what sort it is.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> If anyone’s work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward;<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> If anyone’s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, and such are you.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Let no one deceive himself; if anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this age, let him become foolish that he may become wise.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, “He grasps the wise in their craftiness”;<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> And again, “The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.”<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> So then let no one boast in men, for all things are yours,<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all are yours,<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> But you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s. <br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="1corinthians-4">4</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> A man should account us in this way, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Here, furthermore, it is sought in stewards that one be found faithful.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> But to me it is a very small thing that I should be examined by you or by man’s day; rather I do not even examine myself.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> For I am conscious of nothing against myself; but I am not justified in this, but He who examines me is the Lord.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> So then do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each from God.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Now these things, brothers, I have transferred in figure to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that you may learn in us the matter of not going beyond what has been written, that none of you may be puffed up on behalf of one, against the other.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> For who distinguishes you? And what do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though not having received it?<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Already you are filled; already you have become rich; you have reigned without us. And I would have it indeed that you did reign, that we also might reign with you.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> For, I think, God has set forth us the apostles last of all as doomed to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> We are fools because of Christ, but you are prudent in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are glorious, but we are dishonored.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Until the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked and buffeted and wander without a home;<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And we labor, working with our own hands. Reviled we bless; persecuted we endure;<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Defamed we exhort. We have become as the offscouring of the world, the scum of all things, until now.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> It is not to shame you that I write these things but to admonish you as my beloved children.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> I exhort you therefore, Become imitators of me.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Now some have become puffed up as though I were not coming to you.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will ascertain not the speech of those who are puffed up but the power.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> For the kingdom of God is not in speech but in power.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> What do you want? Should I come to you with a rod or in love and a spirit of meekness? <br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="1corinthians-5">5</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication that does not even occur among the Gentiles, that someone has his stepmother.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And you are puffed up? And have you not rather mourned, that the one who has done this deed might be removed from your midst?<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> For I, on my part, though being absent in the body but present in the spirit, have already judged, as if being present, him who has thus done this,<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you and my spirit have been assembled, with the power of our Lord Jesus,<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened; for our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> So then let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> I wrote to you in my letter not to mingle with fornicators,<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> But not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and rapacious, or idolaters, since then you would have to go out of the world.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> But now I have written to you not to mingle with anyone who is called a brother, if he is a fornicator or a covetous man or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a rapacious man, with such a one not even to eat.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> For what have I to do with judging those who are outside the church? Do you not judge those who are within the church?<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> But those who are outside, God will judge. Remove the evil man from among yourselves. <br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="1corinthians-6">6</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Does any one of you who has a case against another dare to be judged before the unrighteous and not before the saints?<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy of the smallest judgments?<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Do you not know that we will judge angels, not to mention things of this life?<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> If then you hold judgments over things of this life, do you seat as judges those who are of no account in the church?<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> I say this to your shame. So there is no one wise among you, who will be able to discern between his brothers?<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> But brother goes to court with brother, and this before unbelievers.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Already then it is altogether a defeat to you that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> But you wrong and defraud, and this your brothers.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be led astray; neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Nor thieves nor the covetous, not drunkards, not revilers, not the rapacious will inherit the kingdom of God.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And these things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> All things are lawful to me, but not all things are profitable; all things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Foods are for the stomach, and the stomach for foods; but God will bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And God has both raised up the Lord and will raise us up through His power.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Absolutely not!<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For He says, “The two shall be one flesh.”<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Flee fornication. Every sin which a man may do is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> For you have been bought with a price. So then glorify God in your body. <br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="1corinthians-7">7</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Now concerning the things of which you wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> But because of fornication, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Let the husband render to his wife that which is due, and likewise also the wife to the husband.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise the husband also does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Do not deprive each other, except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then be together again, that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> But this I say by way of concession, not by way of command.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Yet I wish all men to be even as I am myself; but each has his own gift from God, one in this way, the other in that.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I am.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with desire.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> But to the married I charge, not I but the Lord, A wife must not be separated from her husband<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> (But if indeed she is separated, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband), and a husband must not leave his wife.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> But to the rest I say, I, not the Lord, If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to dwell with him, he must not leave her;<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And a wife who has an unbelieving husband, and if he consents to dwell with her, must not leave her husband.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother; otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> But if the unbelieving one separates, let him separate; the brother or the sister is not enslaved in such cases, but God has called us in peace.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> However as the Lord has apportioned to each one, as God has called each one, so let him walk. And so I direct in all the churches.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Was anyone called having been circumcised? He need not efface it. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? He need not be circumcised.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of God’s commandments is what counts.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Each one, in the calling in which he was called, in this let him remain.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> Were you called as a slave? Let it not concern you; but even if you are able to become free, use your status as a slave rather.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lord’s freedman; likewise the free man who has been called is Christ’s slave.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> You were bought with a price; do not be slaves of men.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Each one, brothers, in what status he was called, in this let him remain with God.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who has been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> I consider then that this is good because of the present necessity, that it is good for a man to be as he is.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> Have you been bound to a wife? Do not seek a release. Have you been released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> But even if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if the virgin marries, she has not sinned; but such ones will have affliction in the flesh, and I am trying to spare you.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> But this I say, brothers, the time is shortened. Henceforth both those who have wives should be as though they had none,<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> And those who weep as though they did not weep, and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, and those who buy as though they did not possess,<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> And those who use the world as though they did not abuse it; for the fashion of this world is passing away.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> But I desire you to be without care. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> But he who has married cares for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> And is distracted. Both the unmarried woman and the virgin care for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit; but she who has married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.<br>
											 <sup>35</sup> But this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a noose upon you but that you may be comely and may wait on the Lord without distraction.<br>
											 <sup>36</sup> But if anyone thinks that he is behaving unbecomingly to his virgin daughter, if she is past the bloom of youth and thus it must be so, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let them marry.<br>
											 <sup>37</sup> But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, and has authority with respect to his own will and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin daughter, he will do well.<br>
											 <sup>38</sup> So then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better.<br>
											 <sup>39</sup> A wife is bound for so long a time as her husband lives; but should the husband fall asleep, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only to one in the Lord.<br>
											 <sup>40</sup> But she is more blessed if she so remains, according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God. <br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> If anyone thinks that he knows anything, he has not yet come to know as he ought to know;<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> For even if there are so-called gods, either in heaven or on earth, even as there are many gods and many lords,<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Yet to us there is one God, the Father, out from whom are all things, and we are unto Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we are through Him.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> But this knowledge is not in all men; but some, being accustomed to the idol until now, eat the food as an idol sacrifice, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> But food will not commend us to God; neither if we do not eat are we lacking, nor if we eat do we abound.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> But beware lest somehow this right of yours become a stumbling block to the weak ones.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> For if anyone sees you who have knowledge reclining at table in an idol temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to the idols?<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> For the one who is weak is being destroyed by your knowledge, the brother because of whom Christ died.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And sinning in this way against the brothers and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Therefore if food stumbles my brother, I shall by no means eat meat forever, that I may not stumble my brother. <br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> If to others I am not an apostle, yet surely I am to you; for you in the Lord are the seal of my apostleship.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> My defense to those who examine me is this.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Do we not have a right to eat and to drink?<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Do we not have a right to take along a sister as a wife, even as the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Or do only I and Barnabas not have the right not to work?<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> What soldier ever serves by his own wages? Who plants a vineyard and does not partake of its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not partake of the milk of the flock?<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Am I speaking these things according to man? Or does the law not also say these things?<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> For in the law of Moses it is written: “You shall not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it for oxen that God cares?<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Or does He say it altogether for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written because the plowman should plow in hope, and he who threshes, in hope of partaking.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> If we have sown to you the spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap from you the fleshly things?<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> If others partake of this right over you, should not rather we? Yet we did not use this right, but we bear all things that we may not cause any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Do you not know that those who labor on the sacred things eat the things of the sacred temple, that those who attend to the altar have their portion with the altar?<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> So also the Lord directed those who announce the gospel to live from the gospel.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> But I myself have not used any of these things; and I have not written these things that it may be so with me; for it is good for me rather to die than — No one shall make my boast void.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> For if I preach the gospel, I have no boast, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> If I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a stewardship.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> What then is my reward? That in preaching the gospel I may present the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> For though I am free from all, I have enslaved myself to all that I might gain the more.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> And to the Jews I became as a Jew in order that I might gain Jews; to those under law, as under law (though I myself am not under law), that I might gain those under law.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> To those without law, as without law (though I am not without law to God but within law to Christ), that I might gain those without law.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> To the weak I became weak that I might gain the weak. To all men I have become all things that I might by all means save some.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And I do all things for the sake of the gospel that I may become a fellow partaker of it.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize? Run in this way, that you may lay hold.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air;<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> But I buffet my body and make it my slave, lest perhaps having preached to others, I myself may become disapproved. <br>

										<h4 id="1corinthians-10">10</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And all were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And all ate the same spiritual food,<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> But with most of them God was not well pleased, for they were strewn along in the wilderness.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Now these things occurred as examples to us, that we should not be ones who lust after evil things, even as they also lusted.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Neither become idolaters, as some of them did; as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play.”<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and there fell in one day twenty-three thousand.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Neither let us test Christ, as some of them tested Him and were destroyed by the serpents.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Neither murmur, just as some of them murmured and perished by the destroyer.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our admonition, unto whom the ends of the ages have come.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> So then let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> No temptation has taken you except that which is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow that you be tempted beyond what you are able, but will, with the temptation, also make the way out, that you may be able to endure it.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> I speak as to prudent men; you judge what I say.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ?<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Look at Israel according to the flesh. Are not those who eat the sacrifices those who have fellowship with the altar?<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> What then am I saying? That what is sacrificed to an idol is anything? Or that an idol is anything?<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> No, but that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become those who have fellowship with demons.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> You cannot drink the Lord’s cup and the demons’ cup; you cannot partake of the Lord’s table and of the demons’ table.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable; all things are lawful, but not all things build up.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Let no one seek his own profit, but that of the other.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> Everything sold in a meat market eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake;<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> For the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> If any of the unbelievers invites you and you wish to go, eat everything that is set before you, asking no question for conscience’ sake.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> But if anyone says to you, This has been offered in sacrifice, do not eat, for his sake who pointed it out and for conscience’ sake.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other’s. For why is my freedom judged by some other conscience?<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> If I partake with thankfulness, why am I spoken evil of concerning that for which I give thanks?<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> Therefore whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> Do not become a stumbling block, both to Jews and to Greeks and to the church of God;<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> Even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own advantage but that of the many, that they may be saved. <br>

										<h4 id="1corinthians-11">11</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> But I praise you because in all things you have remembered me and hold fast the things that I have handed down even as I handed them down to you.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraces his head.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head; for it is one and the same as she who is shaved.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is God’s image and glory; but the woman is the glory of the man.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man;<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Therefore the woman ought to have a sign of submission to authority on her head for the sake of the angels.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> However neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> For just as the woman is out from the man, so also is the man through the woman; but all things are out from God.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Judge this in your own selves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray uncovered to God?<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> But if anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a custom of being so, neither the churches of God.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> But I give you this charge and do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and some part of it I believe.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> For there must even be parties among you, that those who are approved may become manifest among you.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> When therefore you come together in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper;<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> For in your eating, each one takes his own supper first, and one is hungry and the other is drunk.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and put those to shame who have not? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I do not praise you.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread,<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> And having given thanks, He broke it and said, This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> Similarly also the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord’s death until He comes.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> But let a man prove himself, and in this way let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not discern the body.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> Because of this many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> But if we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> But being judged by the Lord, we are disciplined that we may not be condemned with the world.<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come. <br>

									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="1corinthians-12">12</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> You know that when you were Gentiles, you were always being led away to dumb idols, whenever and however you were led.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit;<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And there are distinctions of ministries, yet the same Lord;<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And there are distinctions of operations, but the same God, who operates all things in all.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is profitable.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> For to one through the Spirit a word of wisdom is given, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> To a different one faith in the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing in the one Spirit,<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And to another operations of works of power, and to another prophecy, and to another discerning of spirits; to a different one various kinds of tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> But the one and the same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one respectively even as He purposes.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> For the body is not one member but many.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> If the foot should say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And if the ear should say, Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were the hearing, where would the smelling be?<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And if all were one member, where would the body be?<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> But now the members are many, but the body one.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> But much rather the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And those members of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely members come to have more abundant comeliness,<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> But our comely members have no need. But God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked,<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> That there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same care for one another.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> Now you are the Body of Christ, and members individually.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all have works of power?<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret tongues?<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And moreover I show to you a most excellent way. <br>

										<h4 id="1corinthians-13">13</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And if I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And if I dole out all my possessions to feed others, and if I deliver up my body that I may boast, but do not have love, I profit nothing.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Love suffers long. Love is kind; it is not jealous. Love does not brag and is not puffed up;<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> It does not behave unbecomingly and does not seek its own things; it is not provoked and does not take account of evil;<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> It does not rejoice because of unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> It covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Love never falls away. But whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless; or tongues, they will cease; or knowledge, it will be rendered useless.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> But when that which is complete comes, that which is in part will be rendered useless.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; since I have become a man, I have done away with childish things.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> For now we see in a mirror obscurely, but at that time face to face; now I know in part, but at that time I will fully know even as also I was fully known.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Now there abide faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love. <br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="1corinthians-14">14</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God; for no one hears, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> But he who prophesies speaks building up and encouragement and consolation to men.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> I desire that you all speak in tongues, but especially that you would prophesy; and greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, that the church may receive building up.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in teaching?<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Yet even lifeless things, whether flute or harp, in giving a sound, if they give no distinction in the tones, how will what is played on the flute or on the harp be known?<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> For also if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle?<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> So also you, unless you give with the tongue a word easy to understand, how will what is being said be known? For you will be speaking into the air.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> There are perhaps many kinds of voices in the world, and not one is without significance.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> If then I do not know the meaning of the voice, I will be to him who is speaking a barbarian, and he who is speaking a barbarian to me.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> So also you, since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> What then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray also with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing also with the mind.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how shall he who fills the place of the unlearned in tongues say the Amen at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> For you give thanks well, but the other is not built up.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> I thank God, I speak in tongues more than all of you,<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> But in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Brothers, do not be children in your understanding, but in malice be babes and in your understanding be full-grown.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> In the law it is written, “By those of other tongues and with the lips of others I will speak to this people; even so they will not listen to Me, says the Lord.”<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> So then tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to the unbelievers; but prophecy is for a sign not to the unbelievers but to those who believe.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> If therefore the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak in tongues, and some unlearned in tongues or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are insane?<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is examined by all;<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> The secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling on his face, he will worship God, declaring that indeed God is among you.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> What then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two, or at the most three, and in turn, and one should interpret;<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> But if there is no interpreter, he should be silent in the church, and speak to himself and to God.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> And as to prophets, two or three should speak, and the others discern.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> But if something is revealed to another sitting by, the first should be silent.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets;<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> For God is not a God of confusion but of peace.        As in all the churches of the saints,<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> The women should be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they should be subject, even as the law also says.<br>
											 <sup>35</sup> But if they desire to learn anything, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.<br>
											 <sup>36</sup> Or was it from you that the word of God went forth? Or did it reach only to you?<br>
											 <sup>37</sup> If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him fully know the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.<br>
											 <sup>38</sup> But if anyone ignores this, let him ignore it.<br>
											 <sup>39</sup> So then, my brothers, desire earnestly the prophesying, and do not forbid the speaking in tongues.<br>
											 <sup>40</sup> But all things must be done becomingly and in order. <br>

											 <sup>4</sup> And that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures;<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve;<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Then He appeared to over five hundred brothers at one time, of whom the majority remain until now, but some have fallen asleep;<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles;<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And last of all He appeared to me also, as it were to one born prematurely.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Therefore whether it is I or they, so we preach and so you have believed.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> But if Christ is proclaimed that He has been raised from the dead, how is it that some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is vain; your faith is vain also.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And also we are found to be false witnesses of God because we have testified concerning God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if indeed the dead are not raised.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> If it is only that we have hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most miserable.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> For since through man came death, through man also came the resurrection of the dead.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> But each one in his own order: the firstfruits, Christ; then those who are Christ’s at His coming;<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Then the end, when He delivers up the kingdom to His God and Father, once He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> For He must reign until God puts all His enemies under His feet.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> Death, the last enemy, is being abolished.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> For He has subjected all things under His feet. But when He says that all things are subjected, it is evident that all things are except Him who has subjected all things to Him.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> And when all things have been subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to Him who has subjected all things to Him, that God may be all in all.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> Otherwise what shall they who are baptized for the dead do? If the dead are actually not raised, why then are they baptized for them?<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> Why also do we brave danger every hour?<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> I protest by the boasting in you, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> If after the manner of men I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> Do not be deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> Awake from the drunken stupor righteously and do not sin, for some of you are ignorant of God. I speak to your shame.<br>
											 <sup>35</sup> But someone will say, How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?<br>
											 <sup>36</sup> Foolish man, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies;<br>
											 <sup>37</sup> And what you sow, you do not sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of some other of the rest.<br>
											 <sup>38</sup> But God gives it a body even as He willed, and to each of the seeds its own body.<br>
											 <sup>39</sup> All flesh is not the same flesh, but one is of men, and another flesh is of cattle, and another is of birds, and another is of fish.<br>
											 <sup>40</sup> There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one thing, and that of the earthly is another.<br>
											 <sup>41</sup> There is another glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.<br>
											 <sup>42</sup> So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;<br>
											 <sup>43</sup> It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;<br>
											 <sup>44</sup> It is sown a soulish body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a soulish body, there is also a spiritual one.<br>
											 <sup>45</sup> So also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul”; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.<br>
											 <sup>46</sup> But the spiritual is not first but the soulish, then the spiritual:<br>
											 <sup>47</sup> The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second man is out of heaven.<br>
											 <sup>48</sup> As the earthy is, such are they also that are earthy; and as the heavenly is, such are they also that are heavenly.<br>
											 <sup>49</sup> And even as we have borne the image of the earthy, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.<br>
											 <sup>50</sup> Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither does corruption inherit incorruption.<br>
											 <sup>51</sup> Behold, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,<br>
											 <sup>52</sup> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.<br>
											 <sup>53</sup> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.<br>
											 <sup>54</sup> And when this corruptible will put on incorruption and this mortal will put on immortality, then the word which is written will come to pass, “Death has been swallowed up unto victory.”<br>
											 <sup>55</sup> Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?<br>
											 <sup>56</sup> The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.<br>
											 <sup>57</sup> But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
											 <sup>58</sup> Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. <br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> Now concerning the collection for the saints, just as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also do.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> On the first day of the week each one of you should lay aside in store to himself whatever he may have been prospered, that no collections be made when I come.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And when I arrive, whomever you approve, I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem;<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And if it is fitting for me also to go, they will go with me.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia, for I will pass through Macedonia.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, that you may send me forward wherever I may go.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> For I do not wish to see you now just in passing, for I am hoping to remain with you for some time, if the Lord permits.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost,<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> For a door is opened to me, great and efficacious, and there are many opposers.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear; for he is working the work of the Lord, even as I am.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Let no one therefore despise him, but send him forward in peace that he may come to me; for I am awaiting him with the brothers.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him many times to come to you with the brothers; yet it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Watch, stand firm in the faith, be full-grown men, be strong.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Let all your matters be done in love.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> Now I exhort you, brothers: You know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and they have set themselves to minister to the saints;<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> You also be subject to such ones, and to everyone co-working and laboring.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Now I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because these have filled up the lack caused by your absence;<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Acknowledge therefore such ones.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you much in the Lord, with the church, which is in their house.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> The greeting in my own hand — Paul.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed! The Lord comes!<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> My love in Christ Jesus be with you all. <br>
