										<h2>Psalms</h2>


										<h4 id="psalms-1">1</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Blessed is the man / Who does not walk / In the counsel of the wicked, / Nor stand on the path of sinners, / Nor sit in the seat of mockers;<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Rather his delight is in the law of Jehovah, / And in His law he meditates by day and by night.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And he will be like a tree / Transplanted beside streams of water, / Which yields its fruit in its season, / And whose foliage does not wither; / And everything he does prospers.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> The wicked are not so, / But are like chaff, / Which the wind drives away.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment; / Nor the sinners, in the assembly of the righteous.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> For Jehovah knows the way of the righteous, / But the way of the wicked will perish.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="psalms-2">2</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Why are the nations in an uproar, / And why do the peoples contemplate a vain thing?<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> The kings of the earth take their stand, / And the rulers sit in counsel together, / Against Jehovah and against His Anointed:<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Let us break apart Their bonds / And cast Their ropes away from us.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> He who sits in the heavens laughs; / The Lord has them in derision.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Then He will speak to them in His anger, / And in His burning wrath He will terrify them:<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> But I have installed My King / Upon Zion, My holy mountain.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> I will recount the decree of Jehovah; / He said to Me: You are My Son; / Today I have begotten You.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Ask of Me, / And I will give the nations as Your inheritance / And the limits of the earth as Your possession.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> You will break them with an iron rod; / You will shatter them like a potterâ€™s vessel.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Now therefore, O kings, be prudent; / Take the admonition, O judges of the earth.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Serve Jehovah with fear, / And rejoice with trembling.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Kiss the Son / Lest He be angry and you perish from the way; / For His anger may suddenly be kindled. / Blessed are all those who take refuge in Him.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="psalms-3">3</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Jehovah, how many are my adversaries! / Many are those who rise up against me!<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Many are those who say of my soul, / There is no salvation for him in God! Selah<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> But You, O Jehovah, are a shield around me, / My glory and the One who lifts up my head.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> With my voice I call out to Jehovah, / And He answers me from His holy mountain. Selah<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> I lay down and slept; / I awoke, for Jehovah sustains me.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> I will not fear the myriads of the people / Who have set themselves against me all around.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Arise, O Jehovah; / Save me, O my God! / <i>Oh</i> that You would strike all my enemies on the cheek; / <i>And</i> break the teeth of the wicked.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Salvation is of Jehovah: / Your blessing be upon Your people. Selah<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="psalms-4">4</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> When I call out, answer me, / O God of my righteousness; / Make room for me <i>when I am</i> in straits; / Be gracious to me and hear my prayer.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> O sons of men, how long will my glory <i>be made</i> a reproach? / <i>How long</i> will you love vanity, will you seek a lie? Selah<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> But know that Jehovah sets apart the faithful man for Himself. / Jehovah hears when I call out to Him.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Be angry, yet do not sin; / Consider in your heart upon your bed, / And be silent. Selah<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Offer sacrifices of righteousness, / And trust in Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Many are those who say, Who will show us <i>any</i> good? / Lift up upon us the light of Your countenance, O Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> You have put joy in my heart, / More than when the grain and new wine of others abound.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> In peace I will both lie down and sleep, / For You alone, O Jehovah, cause me to dwell in safety.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="psalms-5">5</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> To my words give ear, O Jehovah; / Consider my moaning.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Give heed to the sound of my cry, / My King and my God; / For to You do I pray.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> O Jehovah, in the morning / You will hear my voice; / In the morning I will set forth <i>my words</i> in order to You, / And I will watch.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> For You are not a God who delights in wickedness; / Evil will not sojourn with You.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Those who boast will not stand / Before Your eyes; / You hate all workers of iniquity.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> You will destroy those who speak lies. / Jehovah abhors a man of bloodshed and deceit.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> But as for me, in the abundance of Your lovingkindness / I will come into Your house; / I will bow down toward Your holy temple / In fear of You.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> O Jehovah, lead me in Your righteousness / On account of those who lie in wait for me; / Make Your way straight before me.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> For there is no truth in their mouth; / Their inward part is corruption itself; / Their throat is an open grave; / They flatter with their tongue.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Hold them guilty, O God; / Let them fall by their own counsels; / Because of the multitude of their transgressions thrust them out, / For they have rebelled against You.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; / Let them shout for joy forever; / And may You spread a cover over them; / And those who love Your name / Will exult in You.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> For You will bless the righteous man, O Jehovah; / You will surround him with favor as with a shield.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="psalms-6">6</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> O Jehovah, do not rebuke me in Your anger, / Nor chasten me in Your burning wrath.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Be gracious to me, O Jehovah, for I am languishing; / Heal me, O Jehovah, for my bones are shaken,<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And my soul is greatly shaken. / But as for You, O Jehovah, how long?<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Return, O Jehovah; deliver my soul; / Save me for Your lovingkindnessâ€™ sake.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> For in death there is no remembrance of You; / In Sheol who can give thanks to You?<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> I am weary with my groaning; / Every night I cause my bed to swim; / With my tears I dissolve my couch.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> My eye is wasted because of grief; / It has aged because of all those who vex me.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, / For Jehovah has heard the sound of my weeping.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Jehovah has heard my supplication; / Jehovah receives my prayer.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> All my enemies will be ashamed and greatly dismayed; / They will turn back; they will be put to shame suddenly.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="psalms-7">7</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> O Jehovah my God, in You do I take refuge. / Save me from all who pursue me, and deliver me;<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Lest he tear my soul like a lion, / Tearing <i>it</i> apart without anyone to deliver <i>it.</i><br>
											 <sup>3</sup> O Jehovah my God, if I have done this, / If there is unrighteousness in my hands,<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> If I have recompensed with evil him who was at peace with me / (Rather, I have delivered him who vexed me without cause);<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake <i>me,</i> / And let him trample my life to the ground / And lay my glory down in the dust. Selah<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Arise, O Jehovah, in Your anger; / Lift Yourself up against the overflowing wrath of those who vex me, / And awake for me: You have commanded judgment.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And let the assembly of the peoples surround You, / And over it return on high.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Jehovah will execute judgment on the peoples; / Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness / And according to my integrity that is with me.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end, / But establish the righteous man. / For the righteous God / Tries the hearts and the inward parts.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> My shield is with God, / Who saves the upright in heart.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> God is a righteous Judge / And a God who has indignation every day.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> If one does not turn, He will whet His sword. / He bends His bow and makes it ready.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And He prepares instruments of death against him; / He has made His arrows fiery <i>shafts.</i><br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Behold, <i>the evil man</i> travails with iniquity; / He conceives mischief and brings forth falsehood.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> He digs a pit and hollows it out, / Then he falls into the hole that he has made.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> His mischief returns upon his own head, / And upon the crown of his own head his violence comes down.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> I will give thanks to Jehovah according to His righteousness, / And I will sing psalms to the name of Jehovah the Most High.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="psalms-8">8</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> O Jehovah our Lord, / How excellent is Your name / In all the earth, / You who have set Your glory over the heavens!<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings / You have established strength / Because of Your adversaries, / To stop the enemy and the avenger.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> When I see Your heavens, the works of Your fingers, / The moon and the stars, which You have ordained,<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> What is mortal man, that You remember him, / And the son of man, that You visit him?<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> You have made Him a little lower than angels / And have crowned Him with glory and honor.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> For You have caused Him to rule over the works of Your hands; / You have put all things under His feet:<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> All sheep and oxen, / As well as the beasts of the field,<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> The birds of heaven and the fish of the sea, / Whatever passes through the paths of the seas.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> O Jehovah our Lord, / How excellent is Your name / In all the earth!<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="psalms-9">9</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> I will give thanks to <i>You,</i> O Jehovah, with all my heart; / I will tell out all Your wonders.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> I will rejoice and exult in You; / I will sing psalms to Your name, O Most High.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> When my enemies turn back, / They stumble and perish at Your presence.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> For You have upheld my right and my cause; / You sit on the throne, judging righteously.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> You have rebuked the nations; You have destroyed the wicked; / You have blotted out their name forever and ever.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> The enemies are finished; <i>they are in</i> perpetual ruins; / And You have uprooted <i>their</i> cities; the very memory of them has perished.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> But Jehovah sits <i>enthroned</i> forever; / He has established His throne for judgment.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And it is He who judges the world with righteousness; / He executes judgment on the peoples with equity.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> And Jehovah is a high retreat for the oppressed, / A high retreat in times of distress.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And those who know Your name put their trust in You, / For You have not forsaken those who seek You, O Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Sing psalms to Jehovah, the Inhabitant of Zion; / Declare His deeds among the peoples,<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> For He who avenges bloodshed remembers those <i>who were slain;</i> / He does not forget the cry of the afflicted.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Be gracious to me, O Jehovah; look on my affliction from those who hate me, / You who raise me from the gates of death,<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> That I may tell out all Your praises / <i>And,</i> in the gates of the daughter of Zion, exult in Your salvation.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> The nations have sunk in the pit that they have made; / In the net that they hid, their own foot is caught.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Jehovah has made Himself known; He has executed justice; / The wicked have been snared in the work of their hands. Higgaion. Selah<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> The wicked will be turned back to Sheol, / All the nations who forget God.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> For not always will the needy be forgotten, / Nor will the hope of the afflicted perish forever.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> Arise, O Jehovah! Let not mortal man prevail; / Let the nations be judged in Your sight.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Put them in fear, O Jehovah; / Let the nations know that they are mortal men. Selah<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="psalms-10">10</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Why, O Jehovah, do You stand far off? / <i>Why</i> do You hide Yourself in times of distress?<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Arrogantly the wicked hotly pursue the poor â€” / May they be caught in the plots that they devise!<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> For the wicked man boasts of the desire of his soul, / And the rapacious man curses, <i>even</i> despises, Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> The wicked man, according to the haughtiness of his countenance, / <i>Says,</i> He will not require <i>it;</i> / All his thoughts are <i>this:</i> There is no God!<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> His ways succeed at all times; / Your judgments are on high, out of his sight; / As for all his adversaries, he snorts at them.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> He has said in his heart, I will not be shaken; / I will be in no trouble forever.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> His mouth is full of curses and of deceit and oppression; / Under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> He sits in the ambushes of the open villages; / In hidden places he murders the innocent; / His eyes secretly watch for the unfortunate.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> He lurks in secret like a lion in <i>its</i> covert; / He lurks <i>ready</i> to seize the poor; / He seizes the poor, drawing <i>them</i> up in his net.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> He stoops, he crouches, / And the unfortunate fall by his mighty <i>claws.</i><br>
											 <sup>11</sup> He has said in his heart, God has forgotten; / He has hidden His face; He will never see <i>this.</i><br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Arise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up Your hand. / Do not forget the poor.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Why does the wicked man despise God / <i>And</i> say in his heart, You will not require <i>it?</i><br>
											 <sup>14</sup> You do see! For You observe mischief and vexation, / To requite <i>it</i> with Your own hand. / To You the unfortunate one commits <i>his cause;</i> / You have been the help of the orphan.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> Break the arm of the wicked man and the evildoer; / Seek out his wickedness until You find no more.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Jehovah is King forever and ever; / The nations have perished from His land.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> You have heard the desire of the lowly, O Jehovah; / You will establish their heart; You will cause Your ears to listen,<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> In order to execute justice for the orphan and the oppressed one, / That the mortal man of the earth may terrorize no longer.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="psalms-11">11</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> In Jehovah have I taken refuge. How can you say to my soul, / Flee to the mountains like a bird?<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> For behold, the wicked bend the bow; / They ready their arrow on the string / To shoot in the dark at the upright in heart.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> When the foundations are destroyed, / What will the righteous man do?<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Jehovah is in His holy temple; / Jehovah â€” His throne is in heaven. / His eyes behold; / His eyelids try the sons of men.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Jehovah tries the righteous man; / But the wicked man and him who loves violence, His soul hates.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> He will rain down snares upon the wicked; / Fire and brimstone and a scorching wind will be the portion of their cup.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> For Jehovah is righteous; He loves righteous deeds. / The upright man will behold His face.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="psalms-12">12</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Save, O Jehovah; for the faithful man is no more, / For the trustworthy have vanished from among the sons of men.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Each man speaks falsehood with his neighbor; / With flattering lips and a double heart they speak.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> May Jehovah cut off all the flattering lips, / The tongue speaking great things,<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Those who said, With our tongue we will prevail; / Our lips are our own: Who is our lord?<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Because of the devastation of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy, / I will now arise, says Jehovah; / I will set him in the safety that he longs for.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> The words of Jehovah are pure words, / Silver refined in a furnace on the earth, / Purified seven times.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> You, O Jehovah, will keep them; / You will guard them from this generation forever.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> The wicked go about all around, / While vileness is exalted among the sons of men.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="psalms-13">13</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> How long, O Jehovah? Will You forget me continually? / How long will You hide Your face from me?<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> How long will I take counsel in my soul / <i>And</i> sorrow in my heart day after day? / How long will my enemy be exalted over me?<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Consider <i>and</i> answer me, O Jehovah my God; / Enlighten my eyes lest I sleep the <i>sleep of</i> death,<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Lest my enemy say, I have prevailed against him, / <i>And</i> my adversaries exult when I am shaken.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> But I trust in Your lovingkindness; / My heart will exult in Your salvation;<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> I will sing to Jehovah, / For He has dealt bountifully with me.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="psalms-14">14</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> The fool has said in his heart, / There is no God. / They are corrupt; they commit abominable deeds; / There is none who does good.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Jehovah looked down from heaven / Upon the sons of men / To see if there was anyone who had insight, / Who seeks after God.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> They have all turned aside; / They are together perverse. / There is none who does good; / There is not even one.<br>

											 <sup>13</sup> He divided the sea and caused them to pass through, / And He made the water stand as a heap.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And He led them with the cloud by day / And all the night with a light of fire.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> He split rocks in the wilderness / And gave <i>them</i> abundant drink, as from the depths.<br>

											 <sup>20</sup> Behold, He struck the rock, / And water gushed out, / And streams overflowed; / Can He also give <i>us</i> bread, / Or provide meat for His people?<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> Therefore Jehovah heard and was angry. / And a fire was kindled against Jacob, / And also anger went up against Israel;<br>

											 <sup>47</sup> He killed their vines with hail, / And their sycamores with ice stones.<br>
											 <sup>48</sup> He gave over their cattle also to the hail / And their herds to the lightning bolts.<br>
											 <sup>49</sup> He sent among them the burning fierceness of His anger, / Overflowing wrath and indignation and trouble, / A mission of angels of evils.<br>
											 <sup>50</sup> He leveled a path for His anger; / He did not spare their soul from death, / But gave their life over to the pestilence.<br>
											 <sup>51</sup> And He struck all the firstborn in Egypt, / The firstfruits of their vigor in the tents of Ham.<br>
											 <sup>52</sup> But He set forth His people like sheep / And led them like a flock in the wilderness.<br>
											 <sup>53</sup> And He led them to safety, so that they did not fear; / But the sea covered their enemies.<br>
											 <sup>54</sup> And He brought them forth to His holy border, / The mountain, which His right hand had acquired.<br>
											 <sup>55</sup> And He drove out the nations before them / And allotted them as an inheritance by line, / And He made the tribes of Israel dwell <i>there</i> in their tents.<br>
											 <sup>56</sup> Yet they put <i>Him</i> to the test and rebelled against God the Most High, / And did not keep His testimonies.<br>
											 <sup>57</sup> And they turned back and dealt treacherously, as their fathers <i>had done;</i> / They turned aside like a deceitful bow.<br>
											 <sup>58</sup> Indeed they provoked Him to anger with their high places / And made Him jealous with their graven images.<br>
											 <sup>59</sup> God heard, and He was angered; / And He greatly abhorred Israel.<br>
											 <sup>60</sup> Thus He forsook the tabernacle in Shiloh, / The tent <i>in which</i> He dwelt among men;<br>
											 <sup>61</sup> And He gave over His Ark into captivity, / And His glory into the hand of the adversary.<br>
											 <sup>62</sup> He also delivered His people to the sword / And was angry with His inheritance.<br>
											 <sup>63</sup> Fire devoured their young men, / And their virgins had no marriage song.<br>
											 <sup>64</sup> Their priests fell by the sword, / And their widows did not lament.<br>
											 <sup>65</sup> Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, / Like a mighty man who shouts because of wine.<br>
											 <sup>66</sup> And He struck His adversaries <i>and sent them</i> back; / He put an everlasting reproach upon them.<br>
											 <sup>67</sup> And He rejected the tent of Joseph, / And the tribe of Ephraim He did not choose.<br>
											 <sup>68</sup> Rather He chose the tribe of Judah, / Mount Zion, which He loved.<br>
											 <sup>69</sup> And He built His sanctuary like the heights, / Like the earth that He has founded forever.<br>
											 <sup>70</sup> Moreover He chose David His servant / And took him from the sheepfolds;<br>
											 <sup>71</sup> From following after the ewes He brought him / To shepherd Jacob His people / And Israel His inheritance.<br>
											 <sup>72</sup> And he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, / And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.<br>

											 <sup>11</sup> The water then covered their adversaries; / Not one of them was left.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Then they believed His words; / They sang His praise.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Soon they forgot His works; / They did not wait for His counsel,<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, / And tempted God in the desert.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And He gave them their request, / But He sent leanness into their soul.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And they were jealous of Moses in the camp / <i>And</i> of Aaron, the holy one of Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> The earth opened, and it swallowed up Dathan / And covered the company of Abiram.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> And a fire burned among their company; / A flame engulfed the wicked.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> They made a calf in Horeb, / And worshipped a molten image.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Thus they exchanged their glory / For the image of an ox that eats grass.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> They forgot God their Savior, / Who had done great things in Egypt,<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> Wondrous deeds in the land of Ham, / Awesome things by the Red Sea.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> Therefore He said that He would destroy them, / <i>And would have,</i> had not Moses His chosen one / Stood in the breach before Him / To turn away His wrath from destroying <i>them.</i><br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Then they despised the pleasant land; / They did not believe in His word;<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> Rather they murmured in their tents; / They did not listen to the voice of Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> Therefore He lifted up His hand <i>and swore</i> to them / That He would make them fall in the wilderness,<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> And that He would make their seed fall among the nations, / And that He would disperse them among the lands.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> Then they joined themselves to Baal-peor, / And ate sacrifices <i>offered</i> to the dead.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> Thus they provoked <i>Him</i> to anger by their actions, / And the plague broke out among them.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, / And the plague was stayed;<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> And it has been accounted to him as righteousness / From generation to generation unto eternity.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> Then they angered <i>Him</i> at the waters of Meribah, / So that it went ill with Moses on account of them;<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> For they rebelled against His Spirit, / And he spoke rashly with his lips.<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> They did not destroy the peoples, / As Jehovah had commanded them;<br>
											 <sup>35</sup> But they mingled themselves with the nations / And learned their practices.<br>
											 <sup>36</sup> And they served their idols, / Which became a snare to them.<br>
											 <sup>37</sup> They also sacrificed their sons / And their daughters to demons,<br>
											 <sup>38</sup> And poured out innocent blood, / The blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; / And the land was polluted with bloodshed.<br>
											 <sup>39</sup> Thus they were defiled by their practices, / And went about as harlots by their actions.<br>
											 <sup>40</sup> And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against His people, / And He abhorred His inheritance.<br>
											 <sup>41</sup> And He gave them over into the hand of the nations: / And those who hated them ruled over them,<br>
											 <sup>42</sup> And their enemies oppressed them, / And they were subdued under their hand.<br>
											 <sup>43</sup> Many times He delivered them, / But they were rebellious in their counsel, / And they were brought low in their iniquity.<br>
											 <sup>44</sup> Yet He regarded their distress / When He heard their cry,<br>
											 <sup>45</sup> And for their sake He remembered His covenant, / And repented according to the multitude of His acts of lovingkindness;<br>
											 <sup>46</sup> And He caused them to find compassion / With all their captors.<br>
											 <sup>47</sup> Save us, O Jehovah our God; / And gather us out of the nations, / That we may give thanks to Your holy name, / That we may glory in Your praise.<br>
											 <sup>48</sup> Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, / From eternity to eternity. / And let all the people say, Amen. / Hallelujah.<br>
