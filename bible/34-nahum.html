										<h2>Nahum</h2>


										<h4 id="nahum-1">1</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> The burden concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Jehovah is a jealous God and One who avenges; / Jehovah avenges and is full of wrath; / Jehovah takes vengeance on His adversaries, / And reserves <i>wrath</i> for His enemies.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Jehovah is long-suffering and great in power / And will by no means clear <i>the guilty.</i> / Jehovah — His way is in the whirlwind and in the storm, / And the clouds are the dust of His feet.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, / And He dries up all the rivers. / Bashan and Carmel languish, / And the sprout of Lebanon languishes.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> The mountains quake because of Him, / And the hills melt, / And the earth is heaved up at His presence, / Indeed the world, and all that inhabit it.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Who can stand before His indignation, / And who can maintain himself in the fierceness of His anger? / His wrath is poured out like fire, / And the rocks are broken down by Him.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Jehovah is good, / A stronghold in a day of distress; / And He knows those who take refuge in Him.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> But with an overflowing flood / He will make a full end of her place, / And He will pursue His enemies into darkness.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> What do you devise against Jehovah? / He will make a full end; / Distress will not arise a second time.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> For though they are entangled like thorns / And like those drunken with their drink, / They will be consumed as fully as dry stubble.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> One went forth from you / Who devises evil against Jehovah, / Who counsels wickedness.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Thus says Jehovah, / Though they are complete in number and even numerous, / Even so they will be cut down; and they will pass away. / And though I have afflicted you, / I will afflict you no more.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And now I will break his yoke from off you / And will snap your bonds asunder.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And Jehovah has commanded concerning you: / No more of your name will be sown; / Out of the house of your gods I will cut off / The graven idol and the molten idol; / I will make your grave, for you are worthless.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> See, upon the mountains / The feet of him who bears the glad news, / Who announces peace! / Keep your feasts, O Judah; / Complete your vows; / For the wicked one will never again / Pass through you; / He will be completely cut off.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="nahum-2">2</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> He who scatters has come up before you: / Keep the fortress, / Watch the way, / Strengthen the loins, / Fortify the power greatly.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> For Jehovah restores / The excellency of Jacob / As the excellency of Israel; / For the emptiers have emptied them out / And destroyed their vine branches.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> The shield of His mighty men is red; / The valiant men are clad in scarlet; / The chariots <i>flash</i> with the shining of steel / In the day of His preparation, / And the spears are brandished.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> In the streets the chariots rush madly; / They dash to and fro in the open squares; / Their appearance is like that of torches; / They dart like lightning.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> The Assyrian king remembers his glorious ones: / They stumble in their march; / They hasten to the wall of the city, / But the <i>besiegers’</i> shelter is prepared.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> The gates of the rivers are opened, / And the palace is dissolved.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And it is determined: She is uncovered; she is carried away; / And her maidens moan, / As with the sound of doves, / Beating their breasts.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Though Nineveh has been like a pool of water all her days, / <i>Now</i> they are fleeing. / Stand! Stand! But no one turns back.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! / And there is no end to what has been prepared. / Oh, the glory of all the desirable vessels!<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Emptiness and void and waste! / And the heart melts, and the knees knock, / And anguish is in all the loins, / And the faces of all of them become pale.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Where is the den of lions / And the feeding place of young lions, / Where the lion <i>and</i> the lioness walked, / <i>And</i> the lion’s whelp; and no one frightened them?<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> The lion tore in pieces, enough for his whelps, / And strangled for his lionesses / And filled his caves with torn prey / And his dens with torn animals.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Indeed I am against you, / Declares Jehovah of hosts; / And I will burn your chariots in smoke, / And the sword will devour your young lions; / And I will cut off your prey from the earth; / And the voice of your messengers will no longer be heard.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="nahum-3">3</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Woe to the bloody city! / She is all full of lies <i>and</i> pillage; / The prey does not depart.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> The sound of the whip, / And the sound of the rattling wheel; / And the horse galloping, / And the chariot jolting by,<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> The horseman making <i>the horse</i> to rear up, / And the sword flashing, / And the spear glittering; / And a multitude of the slain, / And a mass of corpses, / And no end to the bodies — / They stumble among their bodies.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> <i>This</i> because of the multitude of harlotries / Of the well-favored harlot, / The mistress of sorceries, / Who sells nations by her harlotries / And families by her sorceries.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Indeed I am against you, declares Jehovah of hosts; / And I will throw open your skirts upon your face, / And I will show the nations your nakedness, / And the kingdoms your shame.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And I will cast abominable filth upon you / And make you appear foolish and make you like a spectacle.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And everyone who sees you / Will flee from you and say, / Nineveh is laid waste. / Who will lament for her? / Where will I seek / Some to comfort you?<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Are you better than No-amon, / Who sat beside the canals / With waters all around her, / Whose bulwark was the sea / <i>And</i> water was her wall?<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Cush was her strength, / As well as Egypt, and it was without end; / Put and the Libyans / Were among her helpers.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> She too was carried away; / She went into captivity; / Her little ones too were dashed to pieces / At the head of every street, / And for her nobles / They cast lots, / And all her great men / Were bound in chains.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> You too will be drunken; / You will be hidden. / You too will seek / A stronghold from the enemy.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> All your fortresses will be <i>like</i> fig trees / With first ripe figs: / If they are shaken, they will fall / Into the mouth of the eater.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Indeed your people are <i>like</i> women / In the midst of you; / Unto your enemies the gates of your land / Are wide open; / Fire devours your bars.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Draw for yourself water for the siege! / Strengthen your fortresses! / Go into the clay, / And tread in the mortar! / Make the brick kiln ready!<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> There will the fire devour you; / The sword will cut you off; / It will devour you like the locust. / Enlarge yourself like the locust; / Enlarge yourself like the locust swarm.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> You have multiplied your merchants / Like the stars of heaven; / The locust strips <i>everything</i> and flies away.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Your princes are like the locust swarm, / And your officials are like hordes of locusts, / Which camp in the hedges / On a cold day, / But when the sun arises, they flee away, / And the place where they are is unknown.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Your shepherds slumber, / O king of Assyria; / Your nobles sleep. / Your people are scattered upon the mountains, / And there is no one to gather <i>them.</i><br>
											 <sup>19</sup> There is no alleviating of your injury; / Your wound is grievous. / All who hear the report of you / Clap their hands over you; / For upon whom has your wickedness / Not passed continually?<br>
