										<h2>Job</h2>


										<h4 id="job-1">1</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and this man was perfect and upright, and he feared God and turned away from evil.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And his possessions were seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels and five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred female donkeys and a great many servants; and this man was greater than all the sons of the east.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> And his sons would go and hold feasts in each one’s house, each on his own day, and they would send <i>word</i> and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> And when the days of feasting ran their course, Job would send <i>word</i> and sanctify them; and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, Perhaps my children have sinned and have cursed God in their heart. Job did this continually.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Then one day, when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, Satan also came among them.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Where have you come from? And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From roving the earth and going about in it.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Have you considered My servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Then Satan answered Jehovah and said, Does Job fear God without cause?<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Have You not set a hedge around him and his household and all that he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his possessions are spread throughout the land.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> But stretch forth Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Here is all that he has, in your hand; only do not stretch forth your hand against him. And Satan went forth from Jehovah’s presence.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Then one day, when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother,<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> A messenger came to Job and said, The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys were feeding beside them;<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And the Sabeans fell <i>upon them</i> and took them away, and they struck the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to relate <i>these things</i> to you.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> While this one was still speaking, another came and said, The fire of God has fallen from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and devoured them; and I alone have escaped to relate <i>these things</i> to you.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> While this one was still speaking, another came and said, The Chaldeans formed three companies and raided the camels and took them, and they struck the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to relate <i>these things</i> to you.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> While this one was still speaking, another came and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother;<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> And suddenly a great wind came from beyond the desert and struck the four corners of the house, so that it fell upon the young people and they died; and I alone have escaped to relate <i>these things</i> to you.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Then Job rose up and tore his clothes and shaved his head and fell to the earth and worshipped.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> And he said, / Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, / And naked I will return there. / Jehovah gives and Jehovah takes away; / Blessed be the name of Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> In all this Job did not sin, nor did he charge God with unseemliness.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="job-2">2</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Then one day, when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, Satan also came among them to present himself before Jehovah.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Where have you come from? And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From roving the earth and going about in it.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Have you considered My servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil. And he still holds fast his integrity, though you have moved Me against him to destroy him without cause.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Then Satan answered Jehovah and said, Skin for skin! Indeed all that a man has he will give for the sake of his life.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> But stretch forth Your hand, and touch his bone and his flesh; and he will surely curse You to Your face.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Here he is, in your hand; only spare his life.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And Satan went forth from Jehovah’s presence and struck Job with severe boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And he took a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and he sat among the ashes.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Should we receive the good from God but not receive the ill? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this misfortune that came upon him, each came from his place, Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite; and they together made an appointment to come to console him and comfort him.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And when they lifted up their eyes from a distance and did not recognize him, they lifted up their voice and wept; and they all tore their clothes and cast dust over their heads toward heaven.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights; but none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="job-3">3</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his <i>birth.</i><br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And Job responded and said,<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Let the day on which I was born perish, / And the night which said, A man has been conceived.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Let that day be darkness; / Let God not seek it from above, / Nor let light shine upon it.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Let darkness and the shadow of death reclaim it; / Let a cloud dwell upon it; / Let the things that blacken the day terrify it.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> As for that night, let deep darkness take hold of it; / Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; / Let it not come up in the number of the months.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Behold, let that night be barren; / Let no joyous shout come in it.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Let those curse it who curse the day, / Who are ready to rouse leviathan.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Let its predawn stars be dark; / Let it wait for light and there be none, / And do not let it see the eyelids of the dawn.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> For it did not shut up the doors of the womb <i>that bore</i> me, / Nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Why did I not die at birth, / Come forth from the womb and expire?<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Why did the knees receive me? / And why the breasts, that I should suck?<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> For now I would have lain down and been undisturbed; / I would have slept; then I would have been at rest<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> With kings and counselors of the earth, / Who rebuilt ruins for themselves;<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> Or with princes who had gold, / Who filled their houses with silver.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Or like a miscarriage that has been concealed, I would not have been, / Like infants that do not see the light.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> There the wicked cease from <i>their</i> troubling, / And there the weary rest.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Captives are altogether at ease; / They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> The small and the great are there, / And the servant is free from his master.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Why does He give light to him who suffers / And life to the bitter in soul,<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> Who wait for death, but it is not there; / And dig for it more than for hidden treasures;<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> Who rejoice to the point of exultation / And are glad when they have found the grave;<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> To the man whose way is hidden / And whom God has hedged in?<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> For my sighing comes as my food, / And my groaning pours out like water.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> For I dread something, and it comes upon me; / And what I fear comes to me.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> I have no ease and I have no quiet / And I have no rest, but trouble comes.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="job-4">4</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> If one attempts a word with you, will you be wearied <i>by it?</i> / But who can refrain from speaking?<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Indeed, you have instructed many, / And you have strengthened the weak hands.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Your words have raised up him who was stumbling, / And you have made the bowing knees firm.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> But now it comes to you, and you are wearied <i>by it;</i> / It touches you, and you are disturbed.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Is not your fear <i>of God</i> your confidence, / And the integrity of your ways your hope?<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Remember now, who, being innocent, has <i>ever</i> perished? / And where have the upright <i>ever</i> been cut off?<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity / And those who sow trouble reap the same.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> By the breath of God they perish, / And by the blast of His anger they are consumed.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> The roaring of the lion and the sound of the fierce lion / And the teeth of the young lions are broken;<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, / And the whelps of the lioness are scattered.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> But a matter has stolen in unto me, / And my ear has received a whisper of it.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> In perplexing thoughts of the night visions, / When deep sleep falls upon men,<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Dread came upon me, and trembling, / And caused all my bones to dread.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And a spirit passed before my face; / The hair of my flesh bristled.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; / A form <i>stood</i> before my eyes; / I heard a murmur of a voice:<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Can a mortal man be more righteous than God? / Can a man be purer than his Maker?<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> If He puts no trust in His servants, / And He charges His angels with error,<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, / Whose foundation is in dust, / Who are crushed like a moth!<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> From morning to evening they are smashed to pieces; / Without any considering <i>it,</i> they continually perish.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> Should their tent cord be plucked up within them, / They die, and not in wisdom.<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="job-5">5</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Call now! Is there anyone who will answer you? / And to which of the holy ones will you turn?<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Surely vexation slays the fool, / And jealousy kills the simpleton.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> I have seen the fool taking root, / But suddenly I cursed his habitation.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> His children are far from safety, / And they are crushed in the gate; and there is no one to deliver <i>them.</i><br>
											 <sup>5</sup> The hungry eat his harvest / And even take <i>it</i> out from the thorns, / And the thirsty pant after his wealth.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> For evil does not come forth from the dust, / Nor does trouble spring forth from the ground.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> But man is born unto trouble, / Just as sparks fly upward.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> But as for me, I would seek after God, / And I would commit my cause to God,<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Who does great things that cannot be searched, / Wonderful deeds that cannot be numbered;<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Who gives rain upon the surface of the earth / And sends water upon the surface of the fields;<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Who sets on high those who are lowly / And puts those who mourn safely above <i>all.</i><br>
											 <sup>12</sup> He frustrates the devices of the crafty, / So that their hands achieve no enterprise.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> He seizes the wise in their own craftiness, / And the counsel of the wily is brought to a sudden end.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> By day they encounter darkness, / And at noon they grope about as in the night.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> But He saves the needy from the sword of their mouth, / From the hand of the strong.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Thus the poor have hope, / And Injustice stops her mouth.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Indeed, blessed is the man whom God corrects; / Therefore do not reject the chastening of the Almighty.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> For He wounds, but He binds up; / He strikes, but His hands heal.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> In six troubles He will deliver you; / Indeed in seven no evil will touch you.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> In famine He will redeem you from death, / And in battle, from the power of the sword.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> From the scourge of the tongue you will be hidden, / And you will not be afraid of destruction when it comes.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> At destruction and at famine you will laugh, / And you will not be afraid of the animals of the earth.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> For you will be in an alliance with the stones of the field, / And the animals of the field will be at peace with you.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> And you will know that your tent is at peace, / And you will inspect your fold and miss nothing.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> And you will know that your seed will be great, / And your offspring like the grass of the earth.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> You will come to the grave at a ripe old age, / Like a shock of grain coming up in its season.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> This is it. We have searched it out; it is so. / Hear then and know it for yourself.<br>
										</p>

									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="job-6">6</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Oh that my vexation were weighed indeed, / And that my ruin were lifted onto the scales together with <i>it!</i><br>
											 <sup>3</sup> For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; / Therefore my words have been rash.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> For the arrows of the Almighty are in me, / The poison of which my spirit drinks up; / The terrors of God are arrayed against me.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Does the wild ass bray over <i>its</i> grass? / Or does the ox low over its fodder?<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Is what is savorless eaten without salt? / Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> My soul refuses to touch <i>them;</i> / They are like putrid food to me.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Oh that I might have my request, / And that God would grant <i>me</i> what I long for;<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> That God would be willing to crush me; / That He would release His hand and cut me off!<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Then there would still be comfort for me; / And I would exult, <i>even</i> in writhing pain that does not spare, / That I did not deny the words of the Holy One.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> What is my strength, that I should wait? / And what is my end, that I should be patient?<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Is my strength the strength of stones? / Or is my flesh bronze?<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Is there any help for me at all within me, / And has wisdom been driven away from me?<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> To him who is fainting <i>there should be</i> kindness from his friend, / Else he will forsake the fear of the Almighty.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> My brothers have dealt as treacherously as a desert brook, / As the rivulets of the desert brooks that pass away,<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Which are turbid because of the ice, / <i>And</i> into which the snow hides itself.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> When they are scorched, they are completely consumed; / When it is hot, they are dried up from their place.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Caravans divert their ways <i>for them;</i> / They go up into the waste and perish.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> The caravans of Tema look <i>for them;</i> / The companies of Sheba long for them.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> They are put to shame because they are confident; / They go there and are confounded.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> So now you have become such; / You see a terrible thing and are afraid.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> Have I said, Give me <i>something?</i> / Or, Pay a bribe for me out of your wealth?<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> Or, Deliver me from the hand of the adversary? / Or, From the hand of the oppressors redeem me?<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Teach me, and I will be silent; / Cause me to understand how I have erred.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> How forceful are upright words! / But what does <i>this</i> reproving from you reprove?<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> Do you think you can reprove words? / But the words of a desperate man are for the wind.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> You would even cast <i>lots</i> over the orphan / And bargain over your friend.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> Now then be pleased to look upon me, / For surely I will not lie to your face.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> Turn now; let there be no injustice. / Indeed turn; my righteousness is still here.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> Is there any injustice on my tongue? / Can my palate not discern calamities?<br>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="desc">
										<h4 id="job-7">7</h4>
										<p><sup>1</sup> Does not man have a term of hard service on earth? / And are his days not like the days of a hired hand?<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Like a servant who longs for the shade, / And like a hired hand who waits for his pay,<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> So I am made to inherit months of vanity, / And nights of trouble are appointed to me.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> If I lie down, I say, / When will I arise? But the evening is long, / And I am full of tossings until the dawn.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt clods; / My skin crusts and then oozes again.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle / And are spent without hope.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Remember that my life is a breath; / My eye will not see good again.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> The eye of him who sees me will not look on me; / Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> The cloud is consumed and goes away: / Likewise he who goes down into Sheol does not come up.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> He returns no more to his house, / Nor does his place know him anymore.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> For my part, I also will not restrain my mouth; / I will speak in the distress of my spirit; / I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Am I the sea, or a sea serpent, / That You must set a watch over me?<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> When I say, My bed will comfort me, / My couch will bear up my complaint;<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Then You scare me with dreams / And terrify me with visions,<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> So that my soul would choose strangulation / <i>And</i> death rather than my bones.<br>

											 <sup>2</sup> How long will you speak these things? / And <i>how long</i> will the words of your mouth be <i>like</i> a mighty wind?<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Does God pervert justice? / Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> If your children have sinned against Him, / He has delivered them into the hand of their transgression.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> If you seek earnestly after God / And make supplication unto the Almighty,<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> If you are pure and upright, / Then surely He will rouse Himself for you / And restore well-being to your righteous habitation.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And though your beginning was small, / Your end will be very great.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> For inquire now of the former generation, / And attend to what their fathers have sought out.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> For we are of yesterday and know nothing, / Because our days upon the earth are a shadow.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Will they not teach you <i>and</i> talk to you / And utter forth words from their heart?<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Can papyrus shoot up without marsh? / Can reeds grow without water?<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> While it is still in its greenness <i>and</i> not cut down, / It withers before all <i>other</i> grasses.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> So are the paths of all who forget God; / And the hope of the profane perishes,<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Whose confidence is cut off, / And whose trust is a spider’s web.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> He leans upon his house, but it will not stand; / He holds fast to it, but it will not endure.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> He is full of sap before the sun, / And his shoots go forth over his garden.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> His roots are entwined around a stone heap; / He looks upon a place of stones.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> If one destroys him from his place, / Then it denies him, <i>saying,</i> I have not seen you.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> Indeed, that is the joy of his way; / And others spring forth out of the dust.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Indeed, God will not reject a perfect man, / Nor will He support evildoers.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> He will yet fill your mouth with laughter / And your lips with shouting.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, / And the tent of the wicked will be no more.<br>

											 <sup>2</sup> I do indeed know that it is so. / But how can a man be righteous before God?<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> If he is pleased to contend with Him, / He cannot answer Him one thing in a thousand.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> He is wise in heart and mighty in strength — / Who has <i>ever</i> resisted Him and come through whole? —<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> He who removes mountains, and they do not know <i>it,</i> / When He overturns them in His anger;<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Who shakes the earth from its place, / And its pillars shake;<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Who commands the sun, and it does not rise, / And seals up the stars;<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Who alone stretched forth the heavens / And trod upon the heights of the sea;<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Who made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, / And the chambers of the south;<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Who does great things that cannot be searched, / Indeed, wonderful deeds that cannot be numbered.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Indeed, He passes by me, but I do not see <i>Him;</i> / And He goes by, but I do not perceive Him.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Indeed, He snatches away; who can stop Him? / Who can say to Him, What are You doing?<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> God does not turn back His anger; / Under Him Rahab’s helpers stoop.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> How then can I answer Him / And choose my words <i>properly</i> with Him?<br>

											 <sup>17</sup> For He crushes me with a whirlwind / And multiplies my wounds without cause.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> He does not permit me to catch my breath, / But fills me with bitterness.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> If <i>we speak</i> of strength, indeed, <i>He is</i> mighty! / Or if of judgment, Who, <i>says He,</i> can appoint Me a time?<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Though I am righteous, my mouth would condemn me; / Though I am perfect, it would prove me perverse.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> I am perfect; I do not regard my soul; / I despise my life.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> It is <i>all</i> one; therefore I say, / He destroys the perfect and the wicked.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> If some scourge suddenly kills, / He derides the despair of the innocent.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; / He covers the faces of its judges. / If not <i>He,</i> then who is it?<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> And my days are swifter than a running messenger; / They flee away, they do not see good;<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> They go by like reed boats, / Like an eagle swooping on the prey.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> If I say, I will forget my complaint, / I will put off my <i>sad</i> countenance and look cheerful;<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> I fear all my pains: / I know that You will not hold me innocent.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> I will be accounted wicked; / Why then do I labor in vain?<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> If I wash myself with soap / And cleanse my hands with lye,<br>

											 <sup>32</sup> For <i>He is</i> not a man, as I am, that I should answer Him, / That we should enter into litigation together.<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> There is no referee between us, / Who may lay his hand upon us both.<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> Let Him take His rod away from me, / And let not the dread of Him terrify me;<br>

											 <sup>6</sup> Its stones are the place of sapphires, / And <i>its</i> dust has gold.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> It is a path known by no bird of prey, / And the falcon’s eye has not seen it.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> The proud beasts have not trodden it; / The fierce lion does not pass along it.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> The miner sends forth his hand into the flinty rock; / He overturns the mountains by <i>its</i> roots.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> He cuts out channels in the rocks, / And his eye sees every precious thing.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle, / And that which is hidden he brings out to the light.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> But where shall wisdom be found? / And where is the place of understanding?<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Man does not know its price, / Nor is it found in the land of the living.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> The deep says, It is not in me; / And the sea says, It is not with me.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> Rare gold cannot be given for it, / Nor can silver be weighed out for its price.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> It cannot be balanced with the gold of Ophir, / With precious onyx or <i>with</i> sapphire.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Gold and glass cannot compare with it, / Nor can vessels of fine gold be exchanged for it.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Coral and crystal cannot be mentioned <i>with it;</i> / Indeed the acquisition of wisdom is above that of pearls.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it, / Nor can it be balanced with pure gold.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> From where then does wisdom come? / And where is the place of understanding?<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> For it is hidden from the eyes of all living / And concealed from the birds of heaven.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> Abaddon and Death say, / We have heard a report of it with our ears.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> God understands the way to it; / He knows its place.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> For He sees to the ends of the earth; / He beholds all that is under heaven.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> When He gave weight to the wind / And apportioned the water by measure,<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> When He made a decree for the rain / And a way for the thunderbolt;<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> Then He saw it and declared it; / He established it and even searched it out.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> And He said to man, / Indeed, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; / And to depart from evil is understanding.<br>

											 <sup>2</sup> Oh that I were as in the months of old, / As in the days when God watched over me;<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> When His lamp shone over my head, / <i>And</i> by His light I walked through darkness;<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> As I was in the days of my prime, / When intimate counsel with God was over my tent;<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> When the Almighty was yet with me, / <i>And</i> my children were around me;<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> When my steps were bathed in milk, / And the rock poured out for me streams of oil!<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> When I went out to the gate of the city, / When I prepared my seat in the square,<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> The young men saw me and hid themselves, / And the aged rose up <i>and</i> stood.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Princes refrained from talking / And laid <i>their</i> hand over their mouth.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> The voice of the nobles was hushed, / And their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> For when the ear heard <i>me,</i> it blessed me; / And when the eye saw <i>me,</i> it bore witness to me;<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Because I delivered the poor man who cried out, / And the orphan who had no one to help him.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> The blessing of him who was perishing came upon me, / And I made the widow’s heart shout for joy.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; / My justice was like a robe and a turban.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> I was eyes to the blind, / And I was feet to the lame.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> I was a father to the needy, / And the cause of him whom I did not know I investigated.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> I broke the jaws of the unjust / And made him drop the prey from his teeth.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Then I said, I will die in my nest, / And I will multiply <i>my</i> days like the sand.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> My root is spread out to the water, / And dew abides on my branch at night.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> My glory is <i>always</i> new with me, / And my bow is renewed in my hand.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> <i>Men</i> listened to me and waited, / And they were silent for my counsel.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> After my words they spoke not again, / And my speech distilled <i>like</i> <i>dew</i> upon them.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> And they waited for me as for the rain, / And they opened their mouth wide <i>as</i> for the late rain.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> I smiled on them — they could not believe <i>it;</i> / And they did not cast down the light of my countenance.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> I chose the way for them and sat as chief, / And I dwelt as a king among the troops, / As one who comforts those who mourn.<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> Then these three men ceased answering Job, for he was righteous in his own eyes.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> And the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled. Against Job was his anger kindled because he justified himself rather than God;<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> And against his three friends was his anger kindled because they had found no answer but had condemned Job.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Now Elihu had waited to speak with Job, because they were older than he.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, his anger was kindled.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said,I am young, / And you are aged; / Therefore I shrank back and was afraid / To declare to you what I know.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> I said, Let age speak, / And let the multitude of years make wisdom known.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> But there is a spirit in man, / And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> It is not the great who are wise, / Nor the old who understand justice.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Therefore I say, Hear me; / I also will declare what I know.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Indeed, I have waited out your words; / I have given ear to your reasonings, / While you searched for what to say.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Indeed I gave you my full attention; / But no one here could refute Job; / None of you answered his words.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Do not say, We have found wisdom; / God will defeat him, not man.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> But he did not arrange <i>his</i> words against me; / Neither will I respond to him with your speeches.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> They are dismayed; they answer no more; / Words fail them.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Then should I wait? For they do not speak, / For they stand still; they answer no more.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> I also will answer what has been apportioned to me; / I also will declare what I know.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> For I am full of words; / The spirit in my inward parts constrains me.<br>

											 <sup>20</sup> Let me speak, that there may be relief for me; / Let me open my lips and answer.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> Let me not, I beg you, respect any man’s person, / Nor flatter any man;<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> But now, Job, hear my speaking, / And give ear to all my words.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Indeed now, I have opened my mouth; / My tongue has spoken in my mouth.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> My words <i>manifest</i> the uprightness of my heart, / And what my lips know they speak sincerely.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> The Spirit of God has made me, / And the breath of the Almighty has enlivened me.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> If you can, respond to me; / Arrange <i>your words</i> before me; take your stand.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Indeed, I am before God as you are; / I too was cut out of clay.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> So no fear of me can terrify you, / Nor can my pressure be heavy upon you.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> You have surely spoken in my hearing, / And I have heard the voice of <i>your</i> words, <i>saying,</i><br>
											 <sup>9</sup> I am clean <i>and</i> without transgression; / I am pure, and there is no iniquity in me.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> See, He finds occasions for hostility against me; / He considers me as His enemy.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> He puts my feet in stocks; / He watches all my paths.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> However, in this you are not right, I will answer you, / For God is greater than man.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Why do you contend with Him, / <i>Saying</i> that He does not answer for any of His affairs?<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> For God speaks in one way, / Indeed in two ways, without any perceiving it —<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> In a dream, a night vision, / When deep sleep falls upon men / In the slumberings upon <i>their</i> beds —<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Then He opens the ears of men / And seals up their instruction,<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> That He may turn man aside <i>from his</i> doing / And hide pride from man.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> He keeps his soul from the pit, / And his life from perishing by the sword.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> He is also chastened with pain upon his bed / And with continual strife in his bones,<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> So that his life abhors bread, / And his soul, fancy food.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> His flesh is so consumed that it cannot be seen, / And his bones that had not been seen stick out.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> And his soul draws near to the pit, / And his life, to the destroyers.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> If there is with him an angel, / An interpreter, one of a thousand, / To declare to man what is right for him,<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Then He will be gracious to him and will say, / Redeem him from going down into the pit; / I have found a ransom.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> His flesh will be fresher than in childhood; / He will return to the days of his youth.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> He will pray to God, and He will accept him, / So that he sees His face with joyous shouting; / And God restores to man his righteousness.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> He will sing to men and say, / I sinned and perverted what was right, / But it was not paid back to me.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> He has redeemed my soul from perishing in the pit, / And my life will see the light.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> Indeed, all these things God accomplishes for a man, / Twice, even three times,<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> To bring his soul back from the pit, / To enlighten <i>him</i> with the light of the living.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> Take heed, Job; hear me. / Be silent, and I will speak.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> If you have anything to say, answer me; / Speak, for I desire to justify you.<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> Then Elihu continued and said,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Hear my words, you wise men; / And you who know, give ear to me.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> For the ear tries words / As the palate tastes food.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Let us choose for ourselves what is right; / Let us know among ourselves what is good.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> For Job has said, I am righteous, / And God has taken away my right;<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Should I lie against my right? / My arrow wound is incurable, <i>though I am</i> without transgression.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> What man is like Job, / Who drinks up scoffing like water,<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity / And walks with wicked men?<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> For he has said, It does not profit a man / To delight himself in God.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Therefore, you men of understanding, hear me: / Far be it from God that He would do evil, / And from the Almighty that He would commit iniquity.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> For He will render a man’s work to him / And will cause a man to find that which is according to his own way.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Indeed in all certainty God will not do evil, / And the Almighty will not pervert justice.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Who has <i>ever</i> put the earth in His charge? / Or who has <i>ever</i> set <i>in order</i> the whole world?<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> If He were to consider Himself <i>only,</i> / He would gather back to Himself His spirit and His breath;<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> All flesh would perish together, / And man would return to dust.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> If then <i>you have</i> understanding, hear this; / Give ear to the voice of my words.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Shall one who hates justice govern? / And will you condemn the just <i>and</i> mighty One,<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> He who says to a king, You worthless one! / <i>And</i> to nobles, You wicked one!<br>

											 <sup>20</sup> In a moment they die, and in the middle of the night / The people are shaken, and they pass away; / And the mighty are taken away, <i>but</i> by no <i>human</i> hand.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, / And He sees all his steps.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> There is no darkness and no shadow of death / Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> For He does not <i>need</i> to consider a man further, / That he should go to God in litigation.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> He breaks mighty men in pieces without inquiry / And puts others in their stead.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> Hence He knows their actions, / And He overturns <i>them</i> in the night so that they are crushed.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> He strikes them as He would evil men, / In a place where <i>all</i> can see;<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> Because they turned aside from following after Him / And would not regard any of His ways,<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him, / And He heard the cry of the afflicted.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> When He is silent, who can condemn <i>Him?</i> / When He hides His face, who can behold Him? / <i>He does so</i> toward a nation and toward a man alike,<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> That no profane man would reign, that there would be no snares for the people.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> For has anyone <i>ever</i> said to God, / I have borne <i>chastisement;</i> I will offend no more;<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> What I do not see teach me; / If I have committed iniquity, I will do it no more?<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> Should He recompense to fit you, since you have rejected <i>it?</i> / For you must choose, and not I. / So speak what you know.<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> Men of understanding will say to me, / As well as the man of wisdom who hears me,<br>
											 <sup>35</sup> Job has spoken without knowledge, / And his words are without insight.<br>
											 <sup>36</sup> I wish that Job were tried to the limit / Because of his answering like evil men.<br>
											 <sup>37</sup> For he adds rebellion to his sin; / Among us he claps <i>his hands</i> / And multiplies his words against God.<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> Then Elihu continued and said,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Do you consider this to be just? / Do you say, My righteousness is more than God’s,<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> So that you say, What advantage is there to me, / What do I profit, more than if I had sinned?<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> I will respond to you with words, / And to your companions with you.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Look unto heaven and see; / And behold the skies: They are higher than you.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? / And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him?<br>

											 <sup>10</sup> But no one says, Where is God my Maker, / Who gives songs in the night,<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth / And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> There they cry, but He does not answer, / Because of the pride of evil men.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Surely God does not hear an empty <i>cry,</i> / And the Almighty does not regard it.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> How much less when you say that you do not behold Him, / That the cause is before Him and you are waiting on Him!<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> But now, because He has not visited <i>in</i> His anger / Nor regarded such great arrogance,<br>

											 <sup>3</sup> I will bring my knowledge from afar / And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> For truly my words are not false; / One perfect in knowledge is with you.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Indeed, God is mighty and does not despise; / <i>He is</i> mighty in strength of understanding.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> He does not preserve the wicked man alive, / But gives justice to the afflicted.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; / And with kings on the throne, / He sets them forever, and they are exalted.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And if they are bound in fetters, / If they are caught in the cords of affliction,<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> He shows them their work / And their transgressions, that they have acted arrogantly.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> He also opens their ear to instruction / And commands that they return from iniquity.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> If they hear and serve <i>Him,</i> / They will spend their days in prosperity / And their years in pleasantness.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> But if they do not hear, they will pass away by the sword / And die without knowledge.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> But those who are profane in heart lay up anger; / They do not cry for help when He binds them.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> They die in youth, / And their life <i>ends</i> among the most defiled.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> He rescues the afflicted by their affliction / And opens their ear through oppression.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Indeed He allures you from the jaws of distress / Into a spacious place, where there is no constraint; / And what is upon your table is full of fatness.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> But you are filled with the judgment of the wicked; / Judgment and litigation have taken hold <i>of you.</i><br>
											 <sup>18</sup> <i>Beware</i> lest wrath allures you into scoffing, / And do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> Will your cry keep <i>you</i> from being in distress, / Or all the forces of <i>your</i> strength?<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Do not long for the night, / When people are taken from their place.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> Take heed; do not turn toward iniquity; / For you have chosen this rather than affliction.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> Indeed, God is exalted in His power: / Who is a teacher like Him?<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> Who has appointed His way for Him? / And who says, You have done wrong?<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Remember to magnify His work, / Of which men sing.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> All mankind has gazed on it; / Man beholds <i>it</i> from afar.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> Indeed, God is great, and we do not know <i>Him;</i> / The number of His years we also cannot search out.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> For He draws up the drops of water / Which distill into rain from His mist,<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> Which the skies pour down / <i>And</i> drop upon man abundantly.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> Can they indeed understand the spreading of the clouds, / The thunderings of His pavilion?<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> Indeed, He scatters His lightning around Him / And covers the roots of the sea.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> For by these He judges the peoples; / He gives food in abundance.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> He fills <i>His</i> hands with lightning / And commands it to strike the mark.<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> Its noise tells of Him; / The cattle as well <i>tell</i> concerning Him who is coming.<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> At this, too, my heart trembles / And leaps from its place.<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> Hear attentively the noise of His voice / And the sound that goes forth from His mouth.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> He sends it forth under the whole heaven, / And His lightning unto the ends of the earth.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> After it a voice roars; / He thunders with the voice of His majesty / And does not withhold the lightning / When His voice is heard.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> God thunders wondrously with His voice; / He does great things that we cannot comprehend.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> For He says to the snow, Fall on the earth, / And to the rain shower and His mighty showers of rain.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> He seals the hand of every man, / That all men may know His doing.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Then the beast enters its lair / And remains in its dens.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Out of <i>its</i> chamber comes the whirlwind, / And from scattering winds, cold.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> From the breath of God ice is yielded, / And the expanse of waters is frozen.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> He also loads the thick clouds with moisture; / He scatters His lightning clouds;<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> And they turn about by His guidance, / That they may accomplish / All that He has commanded them / Upon the surface of the inhabited earth;<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Whether for scourge or for His land / Or for lovingkindness’ sake, He causes it to happen.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Give ear to this, Job; / Stand still and consider the wondrous acts of God.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> Do you know how God lays <i>His charge</i> upon them / And causes His lightning clouds to shine?<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Do you know about the balancing of the thick clouds, / The wondrous acts of Him who is perfect in knowledge?<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> You whose garments heat up / When, because of the south wind, the earth is still,<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Can you spread out the skies with Him, / <i>The skies</i> which are as hard as a molten mirror?<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> Teach us what to say to Him; / We cannot arrange <i>our words</i> because of the darkness.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Should it be said to Him, I will speak? / Or should a man say that he will be swallowed up?<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> But now men do not look at the light, / Which is brilliant in the skies / When the wind has passed and cleared them.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> Out of the north comes golden splendor; / Upon God is the awesomeness of majesty.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> The Almighty — we cannot find Him out; / He is excellent in power, / And justice and the abundance of righteousness He will not damage.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Therefore men fear Him; / He does not look upon any who are wise of heart.<br>

											 <sup>3</sup> Gird up now your loins like a mighty man; / For I will ask of you, and you shall inform Me.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? / Tell <i>Me,</i> if you have understanding.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Who set its measurements — if you know? / Or who stretched the measuring line over it?<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Onto what were its bases sunk, / Or who laid its cornerstone,<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> When the morning stars sang together / And all the sons of God shouted for joy?<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> And <i>who</i> hedged in the sea with doors / When it burst forth, issuing from the womb,<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> When I made clouds its clothing / And deep darkness its swaddling clothes,<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And I broke out My boundaries for it / And set up bars and doors,<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And I said, To here you shall come and no farther, / And here shall your proud waves be stopped?<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Have you ever commanded the morning since your days <i>began?</i> / Have you ever caused the dawn to know its place,<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> So that it might take hold of the ends of the earth, / And the wicked might be shaken out of it?<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> The earth is changed like clay under a seal, / And all things on it stand forth like a garment.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And from the wicked their light is withheld, / And the high arm is broken.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Have you entered into the springs of the sea, / Or have you walked about in the recesses of the deep?<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Have the gates of death been revealed to you, / Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> Have you comprehended the full expanse of the earth? / Declare <i>it,</i> if you know it all.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> Where is the way to the dwelling of the light? / And the darkness, where is its place,<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> That you may take it to its boundary, / And that you may perceive the paths to its house?<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> You know, for you were born then, / And the number of your days is great.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> Have you entered into the storehouses of the snow, / Or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> Which I have reserved for the day of calamity, / For the day of battle and of war?<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Where is the way to <i>the place where</i> the light is divided, / To <i>the place where</i> the east wind scatters upon the earth?<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> Who cut a channel for the rain torrent, / Or a way for the thunderbolt,<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> To make it rain on a land where no man is, / <i>On</i> a wilderness in which there is no man;<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> To satisfy the waste and desolate land / And to cause the shoots of grass to sprout?<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> Does the rain have a father? / Or who begot the drops of dew?<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> From whose womb does the ice come forth? / And the frost of heaven, who gave birth to it?<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> The waters hide themselves <i>and become</i> like stone, / And the surface of the deep is frozen.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> Can you fasten the bands of the Pleiades, / Or loosen the cords of Orion?<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? / Or can you guide the Bear with its cubs?<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> Do you know the laws of the heavens? / Do you establish their rule on the earth?<br>
											 <sup>34</sup> Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, / So that a flood of water would cover you?<br>
											 <sup>35</sup> Can you send forth lightnings, so that they would go / And say to you, Here we are?<br>
											 <sup>36</sup> Who has put wisdom in the inward parts, / Or given understanding to the mind?<br>
											 <sup>37</sup> Who can number the clouds by wisdom, / Or who can tip over the water jars of heaven,<br>
											 <sup>38</sup> When the dust runs into a mass / And the clods stick together?<br>
											 <sup>39</sup> Can you hunt prey for the lioness, / Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,<br>
											 <sup>40</sup> When they crouch in their dens, / <i>When</i> they lie in wait in the thicket?<br>
											 <sup>41</sup> Who provides for the raven its prey / When its young ones cry out to God / <i>And</i> wander about for lack of food?<br>

											 <sup>3</sup> They crouch down; they give birth to their young ones; / They send forth their offspring.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Their young become strong; they grow up in the open field; / They go forth and do not return to them.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> Who has sent out the wild ass free? / Or who has loosed the bonds of the swift ass,<br>

											 <sup>8</sup> He searches out the mountains for his pasture / And seeks after every green thing.<br>

											 <sup>16</sup> She is hard with her children, as if they were not hers; / Though her labor may be in vain, <i>she has</i> no fear;<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> Because God has caused her to forget wisdom / And has not appointed understanding to her.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> At that time when she lifts herself up on high, / She scorns the horse and its rider.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> Have you given the horse <i>his</i> might? / Have you clothed his neck with the quivering mane?<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Have you made him to leap like a locust? / His majestic snorting is terrible.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> He paws in the valley, / And he rejoices in <i>his</i> strength; / He goes forth to meet weapons.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> He laughs at fear and is not dismayed, / And he does not turn back from the sword.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> A quiver <i>of arrows</i> rattles against him, / The flashing spear and the javelin.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> With fierceness and rage he swallows the ground, / And he cannot stand still at the sound of the trumpet.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> As often as the trumpet <i>sounds,</i> he says, Aha! / And from afar he smells the battle, / The thundering of captains and the shouting.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars, / Stretching his wings to the south?<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up / And makes his nest on high?<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> On the cliff he dwells and makes his lodging, / Upon the point of the cliff and the stronghold.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> From there he spies out food; / His eyes gaze on <i>it</i> from afar.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> And his young ones suck up the blood; / And where the slain are, there he is.<br>

											 <sup>5</sup> I have spoken once, and I will not answer; / And twice, and I will proceed no further.<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> And Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> Gird up now your loins like a mighty man; / For I will ask of you, and you shall inform Me.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Will you indeed annul My judgment? / Will you condemn Me so that you may be justified?<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> Or do you have an arm like God’s, / And can you thunder with a voice like His?<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> Deck yourself now with majesty and excellency, / And array yourself with honor and splendor.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Pour forth the overflowings of your anger, / And look upon everyone who is proud, and abase him.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Look upon everyone who is proud; bring him down; / And tread down the wicked where they stand.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Hide them in the dust together; / Bind their faces in the hidden place.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> Then even I will praise you, / That your own right hand can save you.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> Behold now the behemoth, which I made as well as you: / He eats grass like the ox.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> Behold now, his strength is in his loins, / And his power is in the muscles of his belly.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> He bends his tail like a cedar; / The sinews of his thighs knit together.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> His bones are like bronze tubes; / His limbs, like iron bars.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> He is the first of God’s ways; / <i>Only</i> his Maker can approach <i>him</i> with His sword.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> For the mountains yield food for him, / Where every animal of the field plays.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> Under the lotus plants he lies down, / In the covert of the reed and the marsh.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> The lotus plants cover him with their shade; / The willows of the brook surround him.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> Indeed, if a river overflows, he does not tremble; / He is confident, though the Jordan rushes against his mouth.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> Will anyone catch him while he is watching, / Or pierce <i>his</i> nose with a snare?<br>

											 <sup>10</sup> No one is so fierce as to stir him up; / Who then is he who would stand before Me?<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> Who has first given to Me that I should repay <i>him?</i> / <i>Whatever</i> is under the whole heaven is Mine.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> I will not be silent about his limbs / Or about the account of his mighty deeds or about the beauty of his frame.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> Who can strip off his outer garment? / Who can go within his double jaws?<br>

											 <sup>17</sup> Each is joined to the other; / They stick together and cannot be separated.<br>
											 <sup>18</sup> His sneezes flash forth light, / And his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.<br>
											 <sup>19</sup> Out of his mouth go forth flaming torches; / Sparks of fire leap out.<br>
											 <sup>20</sup> Out of his nostrils comes smoke, / As from a boiling pot and <i>burning</i> rushes.<br>
											 <sup>21</sup> His breath kindles coals, / And a flame comes from his mouth.<br>
											 <sup>22</sup> In his neck abides strength, / And terror dances before him.<br>
											 <sup>23</sup> The folds of his flesh are joined together; / They are firm upon him <i>and</i> immovable.<br>
											 <sup>24</sup> His heart is as firm as stone, / Indeed as firm as the lower millstone.<br>
											 <sup>25</sup> At his rising up, the mighty fear; / They are beside themselves with consternation.<br>
											 <sup>26</sup> The sword that reaches him cannot avail, / Nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin.<br>
											 <sup>27</sup> He considers iron <i>shafts</i> as straw, / And bronze <i>ones</i> as rotted wood.<br>
											 <sup>28</sup> The arrow does not make him flee; / With him slingstones turn to stubble.<br>
											 <sup>29</sup> Clubs are considered as stubble; / He laughs at the quivering javelin.<br>
											 <sup>30</sup> His underparts are <i>like</i> sharp potsherds; / He spreads himself <i>like</i> a threshing sledge upon the mire.<br>
											 <sup>31</sup> He makes the deep boil like a cauldron; / He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.<br>
											 <sup>32</sup> Behind him he makes a shining wake; / One would think the deep to be white-haired.<br>
											 <sup>33</sup> On earth there is none his equal, / Who is made without fear.<br>

										<p><sup>1</sup> Then Job answered Jehovah and said,<br>
											 <sup>2</sup> I know that You can do all things / And that no purpose of Yours can be restrained.<br>
											 <sup>3</sup> Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge? / Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, / Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.<br>
											 <sup>4</sup> Hear now, and I will speak; / I will ask of You, and You shall inform me.<br>
											 <sup>5</sup> I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear, / But now my eye has seen You;<br>
											 <sup>6</sup> Therefore I abhor <i>myself,</i> and I repent / In dust and ashes.<br>
											 <sup>7</sup> And after Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My anger is kindled against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken concerning Me that which is right, as My servant Job has.<br>
											 <sup>8</sup> Now therefore take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer them as a burnt offering for yourselves. And My servant Job will pray for you; for I will accept him, so that I do not deal with you <i>according to your</i> folly; for you have not spoken concerning Me that which is right, as My servant Job has.<br>
											 <sup>9</sup> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as Jehovah told them; and Jehovah accepted Job.<br>
											 <sup>10</sup> And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends, and Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before.<br>
											 <sup>11</sup> And all his brothers and all his sisters and all his previous acquaintances came to him and ate bread with him in his house. And they consoled and comforted him for all the misfortune that Jehovah had brought upon him. And each gave to him a piece of money, and each, a gold ring.<br>
											 <sup>12</sup> Thus Jehovah blessed Job’s latter end more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep and six thousand camels and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand female donkeys.<br>
											 <sup>13</sup> And he had seven sons and three daughters.<br>
											 <sup>14</sup> And he named the first Jemimah, and the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch.<br>
											 <sup>15</sup> And in all the land no women were found as beautiful as the daughters of Job. And their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.<br>
											 <sup>16</sup> And after this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; and he saw his children and his grandchildren, <i>even</i> four generations.<br>
											 <sup>17</sup> And Job died, old and full of days.<br>
